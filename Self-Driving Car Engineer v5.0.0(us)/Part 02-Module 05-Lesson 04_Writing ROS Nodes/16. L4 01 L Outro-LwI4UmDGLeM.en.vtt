Congratulations.

00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:03.014
In the past few lessons,

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:06.435
you've explored ROS topics and messages from the command line,

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:08.144
written and launched ROS nodes,

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:10.929
and both published and subscribed to topics.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.289
Great work. You're ready to start the final project of the entire nanodegree program.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.559
In this project, you'll write ROS nodes to implement and

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.134
integrate various features of the car's autonomous driving system.

00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:24.720
At the end of the project,

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.629
you'll run your code on Carla. Let's get started.
