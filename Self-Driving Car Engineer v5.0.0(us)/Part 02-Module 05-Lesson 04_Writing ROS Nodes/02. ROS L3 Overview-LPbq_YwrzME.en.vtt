00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Now that you've created a KAT can workspace and added the simple arm package to it,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.835
you're ready to write some Ross nodes.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:10.589
In this lesson, you'll be writing notes in Python that publish and subscribe to topics.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.330
And you'll write a Ross service that can be called

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.914
from other nodes or from the command line.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.535
The first node that you'll be writing is called simple mover.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:22.214
The simple mover node does nothing more than publish joint angle commands to simple arm.

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:26.634
After you've developed a basic understanding of the general structure of a Ross node,

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:29.170
you'll be writing another node called arm mover.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.579
The arm mover node provides a service called safe move,

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.009
which allows the arm to be moved to any position

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.244
within its workspace which has been deemed to be safe.

00:00:38.244 --> 00:00:39.839
The safe zone is bounded by

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.210
minimum and maximum joint angles and it's configurable via the Ross parameter server.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.075
The last node you'll write in this lesson, is the look away node.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:51.620
This node subscribes to a topic where camera data is being published.

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.195
When the camera detects an image with uniform color,

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:56.045
meaning that it's looking at the sky,

00:00:56.045 --> 00:01:00.429
the node will call the safe move service to move the arm to a new position.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.049
With these new skills, you'll have everything you need to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.390
tackle the upcoming projects in this program.
