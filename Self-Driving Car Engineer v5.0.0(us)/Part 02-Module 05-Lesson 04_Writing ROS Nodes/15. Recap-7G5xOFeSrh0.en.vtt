00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.254
Congratulations, you've now come to the conclusion of ROS Essentials.

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:06.549
Armed with the understanding of ROS you've learned here,

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.074
you are now prepared for the projects to come.

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:10.529
While we've done our best to give you

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.640
a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of ROS,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.515
the lessons here are by no means comprehensive.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.339
Fortunately there are a wealth of resources available online.

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.609
For example, there's the ROS Wiki.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.670
The ROS Wiki is the official source of documentation for all ROS packages.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.304
Additionally, there are many helpful tutorials there.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.149
Aside from a simple search on Google,

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.825
this is probably the first place you should go if you're having ROS related problems.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:37.740
If the Wiki doesn't provide the answers you're looking for,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.225
ROS Answers will be the next best bet.

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:43.263
With tens of thousands of questions answered on Ross Answers,

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:45.149
there's a good chance that somebody has

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.039
already solved the problem that you're dealing with.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.000
And there you have it. With these tools you're ready to start building.
