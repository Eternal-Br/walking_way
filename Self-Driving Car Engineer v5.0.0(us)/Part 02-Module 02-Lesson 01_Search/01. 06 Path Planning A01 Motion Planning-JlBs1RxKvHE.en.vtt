00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629
So, now onto motion planning.

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.044
So far, you've learned a lot about perception,

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:06.974
like how to perceive the world.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:10.890
But while the car brains will taking vision in, eventually,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.605
you have to also do something with that,

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:14.150
we have to steer,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.789
and you have to break, and give gas.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.750
So, motion planning is a step in that direction.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.190
It comes in multiple segments.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.580
It starts out with a predictive task where

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.414
the motion planner tries to understand what are other vehicles about to do in the future.

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:32.979
Then the vehicle will pick a behavior kind of simply speaking,

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:34.634
whether to left or right.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:39.009
Eventually, it generates a maneuver trajectory as to where to go.

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.195
The trajectory is not just a curve in space in X and Y.

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:44.500
It also has a time dimension because

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.280
we have to set the speed of the vehicle at the same time.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310
So, now, in this unit,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.370
you will actually be asked to write a lot of software.

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:56.464
It's very coding intents to build this very important package.

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.540
By the end of the unit, you have a flavor for

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.759
how complicated as not much fun it is to make a car move.
