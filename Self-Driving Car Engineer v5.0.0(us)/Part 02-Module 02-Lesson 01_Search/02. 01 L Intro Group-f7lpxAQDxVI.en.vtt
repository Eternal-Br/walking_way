00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome to Path Planning.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.020
Path planning is how the vehicle generates

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.250
safe drivable trajectories to get where we want it to go.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.169
We'll use data from computer vision and

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.820
sensor fusion in order to understand the environment around us.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.050
We'll also use data from localization to

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.525
understand precisely where we are in that environment.

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:24.436
The path planning block uses all of that data to decide which maneuver to take next.

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:27.980
Then it constructs a trajectory for the controller to execute.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.089
In the first lesson you'll learn some of

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.554
the foundational search algorithms used in discrete path planning.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:37.740
Then you will learn about prediction which is where we use the data from

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.605
sensor fusion to generate predictions about

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:44.245
what all the other objects around us are likely to do.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:47.240
Then you'll study about behavior planning.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.620
This is where we decide at a high level what

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.394
the car shall do in the next 10 seconds or so.

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:57.060
Finally you will learn about trajectory generation which is where we create smooth,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.587
drivable, and collision-free trajectories for the motion controller to follow.

00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:04.320
In the project at the end of this module you'll

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.369
implement a path planner for a vehicle driving on a highway.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.980
Your vehicle will be able to avoid collisions,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.570
maintain safe distances between other traffic,

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.000
and even pass other vehicles to get where it's going faster.
