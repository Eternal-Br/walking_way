00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
All right. You're beginning to impress me because you just

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.445
coded a piece of neural network that found traffic signs,

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:09.484
and that's actually nontrivial.

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:11.459
For many decades, it was really hard for

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.045
computer vision researcher to do what you just did to be honest.

00:00:14.044 --> 00:00:17.129
But now, it's time to scale up.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.289
You're not going to do anything by hand anymore,

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.890
you're going to use existing tools.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.820
Carrier system that we chose is built on TensorFlow by Google,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.774
and is a tool that makes building deep networks easy and effective.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.689
The reason why we do this is because we want you to

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.480
experience building bigger and better things.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.394
As I mentioned, the human brain has over 10 to the 11 neurons.

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:38.785
You haven't played with that many yet.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:41.014
But to make a machine really smart,

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:43.719
you need to build really big brains.
