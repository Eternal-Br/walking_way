00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.314
&gt;&gt; Now, we're going to introduce you to a high level framework called Keras,

00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:06.769
that sits on top of TensorFlow and provides a simplified interface.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:08.539
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds great. At Otto,

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.119
if we need a lot of flexibility and we really want to customize layer creation,

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.619
we'll go straight to TensorFlow.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.051
But sometimes we can get everything we need out of a friendly interface like Keras.

00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:19.669
And it makes believe that it works much faster and cleaner.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.210
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, let's go check out Keras.
