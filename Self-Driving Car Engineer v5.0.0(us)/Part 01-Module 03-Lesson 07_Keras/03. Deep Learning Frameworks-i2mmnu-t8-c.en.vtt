00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.390
&gt;&gt; To help us with this lesson,

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.085
we're excited to welcome Drew Gray,

00:00:03.085 --> 00:00:05.295
who's leading the self-driving car team at Otto

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:07.710
which is now part of Uber. Thanks for joining us Drew.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.730
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.370
&gt;&gt; So Drew, can you tell us a little bit more about how

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.310
you use deep learning for self-driving cars at Otto.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.065
&gt;&gt; For sure. Deep neural networks have been a big focus of my work at Otto.

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:20.085
We're exploring whether we can get a car to drive itself,

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:22.650
using only deep neural networks and nothing else.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.465
Sometimes we call that behavioral cloning

00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:27.240
because you're training the network that clone human driving behavior.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.150
Well, sometimes it's called end-to-end learning because the network

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.065
is learning to predict the correct steering angle and speed,

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.550
using only the inputs from the sensors.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.390
&gt;&gt; So as I understand it, deep learning isn't

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.655
the only approach to building a self-driving car.

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:40.440
For a number of years, people have been working on

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.855
a more traditional sort of robotics approach.

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.100
So, why go with deep learning over robotics approach?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.040
&gt;&gt; Right. Well, my Ph.D. is actually in control theory and artificial intelligence.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.230
So, I spent a lot of time working on both approaches.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.940
In fact, engineers at Otto are working on

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810
both deep learning and the standard robotics approach.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.280
I'm working on deep learning because I think it has the potential to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.920
fundamentally change how we develop self-driving cars.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.320
&gt;&gt; Cool. Can you explain a little bit more about

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.055
the difference between the deep learning approach versus the robotics approach.

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:10.470
&gt;&gt; The robotics approach in building self-driving cars involves a lot

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.275
of detail knowledge about sensors, controls and planning.

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:14.700
With the deep learning approach,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.620
we don't have to program all that detail knowledge into the vehicle.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.485
We simply feed all the information we have into the network,

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:23.260
and then we let the network figure out on its own what's important.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.060
Also, deep learning allows us to build a feedback loop where the more we drive,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.395
the more data we can collect,

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:30.870
which in turn allows us to learn how to drive even better.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.330
&gt;&gt; So, what you're doing sounds pretty similar to what

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.230
students will be doing in their final project at the end of this module,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.300
only they'll be implementing behavioral cloning and simulator.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.520
&gt;&gt; Well, a simulator certainly makes things easier,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.140
but the overarching principles are the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620
same whether you're in the simulator or a real vehicle.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but can you actually drive a real vehicle with just a deep neural network?

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.660
&gt;&gt; You can. We actually recently drove 20 miles

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.165
down the highway in San Francisco to the airport and back,

00:01:54.165 --> 00:01:56.070
without touching the steering wheel once.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.170
&gt;&gt; Wow. So it really works.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.450
Well then, let's get started building a deep neural network.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.110
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.
