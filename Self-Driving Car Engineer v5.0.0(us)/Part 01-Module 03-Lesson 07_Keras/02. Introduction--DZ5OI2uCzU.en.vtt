00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
&gt;&gt; Congratulations!

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.729
You've built neural networks from scratch, you've mastered TensorFlow,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.070
and now we're going to show you how to build and train

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.315
a multilayer convolutional neural network in even fewer lines of code.

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:17.910
In this lesson, we'll be introducing an interface that sits on top of TensorFlow,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.894
and allows you to draw on the power of TensorFlow with far more concise code.

00:00:22.894 --> 00:00:24.254
&gt;&gt; That's right. In this lesson,

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:27.710
you'll be building a deep neural network using a new set of tools.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.490
You'll still have TensorFlow under the hood,

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.000
but with an interface that makes testing and prototyping much faster.
