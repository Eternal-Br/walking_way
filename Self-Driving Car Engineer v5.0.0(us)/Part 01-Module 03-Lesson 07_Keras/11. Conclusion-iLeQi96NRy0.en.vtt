&gt;&gt; The work we just did, building and training a multi-layer convolutional neural network,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.560
would have taken hundreds of lines of code just a few years ago.

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.050
&gt;&gt; That's right. As deep neural networks become increasingly

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.900
important to everything from self-driving cars to voice recognition,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.949
new libraries are making it much easier to use deep learning to solve real problems.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.015
&gt;&gt; Next up, you're going to learn how to take networks that have already been trained,

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:25.449
and fine-tune them to accelerate your own work. This is called transfer learning.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.869
&gt;&gt; Transfer learning is a standard tool in deep learning.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.640
It really reduces your training time and improve your results.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.519
&gt;&gt; See you soon!
