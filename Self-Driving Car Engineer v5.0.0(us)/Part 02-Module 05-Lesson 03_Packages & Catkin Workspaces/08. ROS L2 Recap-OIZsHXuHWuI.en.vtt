00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Congratulations.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.095
You now have some experience creating workspaces,

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:05.865
working with packages and dependencies,

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:07.800
and troubleshooting build errors.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.064
Additionally you've had your first peek at Gazebo,

00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:12.209
a powerful tool for simulation that you'll be

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.730
using over and over again throughout this curriculum.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.580
In the next lesson you'll be writing additional ROS nodes for

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.879
the simple arm package that you've already added to your catkin workspace.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.689
Before you actually begin writing ROS nodes make sure to take a peek at the links

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.145
to the official ROS wiki documentation surrounding the topics I've discussed here.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.800
The documentation is an extremely useful resource for

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.000
ROS developers and will be very valuable to you throughout the rest of the program.
