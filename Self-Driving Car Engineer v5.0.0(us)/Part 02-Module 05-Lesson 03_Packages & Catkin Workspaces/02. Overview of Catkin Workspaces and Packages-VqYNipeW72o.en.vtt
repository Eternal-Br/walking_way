00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
ROS provides a powerful build and package management system called Catkin.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.620
Willow Garage, the early developers of ROS,

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.980
named Catkin after the flowers on the willow trees surrounding their office.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.380
A Catkin workspace is essentially a directory where

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.739
Catkin packages are built, modified and installed.

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.839
Typically when you're developing a ROS based robot or project,

00:00:19.838 --> 00:00:22.500
you will be working out of a single workspace.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.324
This singular workspace will hold a wide variety of Catkin packages.

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:30.958
All ROS software components are organized into and distributed as Catkin packages.

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.990
Similar to workspaces, Catkin packages are

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.439
nothing more than directories containing a variety of resources which,

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:41.445
when considered together constitute some sort of useful module.

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:44.689
Catkin packages may contain source code for nodes,

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:48.228
useful scripts, configuration files and more.

00:00:48.228 --> 00:00:49.545
In the sections that follow,

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:51.664
you will see how to create a Catkin workspace,

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:53.060
add packages to it,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.134
manage inner package dependencies,

00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:58.329
and lastly, how to successfully compile everything.
