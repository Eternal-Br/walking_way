00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
So, now that they know the basics about ROS,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.480
let's dive into how to bundle packages together and build a software system.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.080
It might sound like a detour

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.470
to do this in ROS as opposed to just one thread in Python but,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.650
I can tell you once you build a self-driving car you often

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.719
have up to 50 processes running at the same time.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:22.229
Some might even crash while you're driving and having

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.420
a flexible architecture like ROS wrapped around it,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.440
it would be supremely helpful to build scalable software.
