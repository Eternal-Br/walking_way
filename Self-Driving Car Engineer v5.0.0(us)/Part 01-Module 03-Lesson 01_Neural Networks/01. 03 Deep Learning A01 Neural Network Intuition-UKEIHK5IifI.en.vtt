00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.519
Perhaps the hottest topic in the world right now is artificial intelligence.

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:05.949
When people talk about this,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.669
they often talk about machine learning,

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:10.150
and specifically, neural networks.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.120
Now, neural networks should be familiar with you.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.824
If you put your hands like this,

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:15.778
left and right, do it,

00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:18.109
then between your hands is a big neural network called

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.600
your brain with something like 10 to 11 neurons, is crazy.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.020
What people have done in the last decades kind of abstracted this big mass in

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.250
your brain into a basis set of equations that emulate a network of artificial neurons.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.009
Then people have invented ways to train these systems based on data.

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:41.939
So, rather than instructing a machine with rules like a piece of software,

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.024
these neural networks are trained based on data.

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:49.280
So, you're going to learn the very basics for now, perception, backpropagation,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.335
terminology that doesn't make sense yet,

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:52.700
but by the end of this unit,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.440
you should be able to write and code and train your own neural network.

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:57.960
That's a ton of fun.
