00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
&gt;&gt; Some of the most important recent breakthroughs in the performance of self-driving cars,

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:05.974
have come from machine learning.

00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:07.679
Two of my Udacity colleagues,

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.879
Luis and Mat, are machine learning experts.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.260
In this lesson, they're going to introduce you to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.850
the foundational concepts in the fields of machine learning and deep neural networks.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.265
Afterward, we'll build on those concepts and apply them to self-driving cars.

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:24.045
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Louis Serrano,

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:26.850
and I lead the Machine Learning Nanodegree program at Udacity.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.000
Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that relies

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.100
on computers to learn about the environment from data,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.939
instead of relying on the rule set by computer programmers.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.144
&gt;&gt; And I'm Mat Leonard,

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:40.310
I lead the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation program.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.539
Deep learning is an approach to machine learning,

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.250
that uses deep neural networks.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.435
Deep learning uses this one tool to accomplish an amazing array of objectives,

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:51.679
from speech recognition, to driving a car.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.579
&gt;&gt; You'll start learning about the perceptron,

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.250
which is the fundamental unit of a neural network.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.134
&gt;&gt; Then you'll learn how to combine these units into a simple neural network.

00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:03.674
&gt;&gt; Before you start learning about neural network though,

00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:05.644
let's go over the basics of machine learning.

00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:07.659
We'll get started by thinking about something a little less

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.000
complex than self-driving cars. Housing prices.
