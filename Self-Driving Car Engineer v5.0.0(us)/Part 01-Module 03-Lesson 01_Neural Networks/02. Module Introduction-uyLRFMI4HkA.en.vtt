00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
&gt;&gt; Here, you're going to learn how to use one of

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:07.259
the most exciting tools and self-driving car development, deep neural networks.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.820
At the end of this module,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.710
you'll create a project that demonstrates

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.600
real world application of the skills you need to become a self-driving car engineer.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.565
&gt;&gt; That's right. In the project you'll train

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:20.304
a deep neural network to drive a car in a simulator.

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:23.579
First, you'll drive and record training laps in simulation and then

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.909
you'll build and train a deep neural network that learns from the way you drive.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.969
&gt;&gt; A deep neural network is just a term that describes a big multi-layer neural network.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.399
&gt;&gt; And a neural network is

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.384
a machine learning algorithm that you can train using input like

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:40.875
camera images or sensor readings and generate

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:45.159
output like what's steering angle the car should take or how fast it should go.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.729
The idea is that the neural network learns from observing the world.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:50.899
You don't have to teach it anything specific.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.750
&gt;&gt; Deep learning is just another term for using deep neural networks to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.890
solve problems and it's become really important for self-driving cars.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.000
&gt;&gt; But deep learning is relatively new.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.454
Until the last few years,

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:06.329
computers simply weren't fast enough to train deep neural networks effectively.

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.640
Now, however, automotive manufacturers can

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
apply deep learning techniques to drive cars in real time.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.103
&gt;&gt; Because deep learning is so new,

00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:16.409
automotive engineers and researchers are

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.475
still experimenting with just how far it can take us,

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:23.730
but deep learning has already revolutionized segments of autonomous driving like

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.340
computer vision and it has the potential to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.430
entirely change the way we develop self-driving cars.
