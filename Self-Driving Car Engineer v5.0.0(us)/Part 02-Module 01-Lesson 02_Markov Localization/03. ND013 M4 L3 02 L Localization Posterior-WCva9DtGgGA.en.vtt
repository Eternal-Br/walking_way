00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.269
Here is a picture from the introduction when you first encountered localization.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.582
We have a map with all these landmarks in a global coordinate system,

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:15.825
observations from the on-board censor and the local coordinates system,

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:21.059
and we also have the information how the car moves between two timesteps.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:25.784
Formally, the observations are defined as a vector z which includes

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:31.800
all observations from timestep one to t. The observations could be range measurements,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.990
bearing angles, or images, for example.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.060
We also have the controls of the car as a vector u which includes

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.290
all control elements from timestep one to t. Typically,

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.030
you have low pitch or roll rates and velocity information.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.829
Finally, we have the map.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.009
The map could be a grid map of the global environment,

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:57.405
or a database which includes global feature points and the lane geometry.

00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:01.020
Here, we do not add the time index t to the map

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.883
because we assume the map does not change over time,

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:09.519
and we assume these variables are known.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.319
Again, what we want to estimate is the transformation between

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:18.794
the local coordinate system of the car and the global coordinate system of the map.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:21.150
If we know this transformation,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.855
then we also know the posts of the car in the global map.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:30.659
The position of the car at time t is defined with x.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.704
If we assume we have a 2D map for example,

00:01:33.704 --> 00:01:41.429
x includes a position with x and y coordinates and also the orientation phi.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.420
And these values are unknown.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.355
We will never know the state xt with perfect accuracy.

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:54.840
What we want is to form a sufficiently accurate belief of the state xt,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.549
and we want to formulate this belief in a probabilistic way.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.000
Now here's a good question: Could you write down the posterior for the belief xt?
