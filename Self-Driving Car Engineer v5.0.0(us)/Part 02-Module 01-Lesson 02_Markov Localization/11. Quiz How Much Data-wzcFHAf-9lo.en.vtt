00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.679
Before we go back to math,

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:06.549
I want to make sure you understand how much data Z1:t represents,

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.740
so you can consider what the performance consequences would be.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.724
So let's pretend that each observation vector

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:17.625
contains 100000 data points or observations.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:24.219
Each of those observations may have five data points which take four bytes each.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:30.404
If we have been driving a car for six hours with our sensor updating at ten hertz,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:36.000
how much data is contained in this Z1:t?
