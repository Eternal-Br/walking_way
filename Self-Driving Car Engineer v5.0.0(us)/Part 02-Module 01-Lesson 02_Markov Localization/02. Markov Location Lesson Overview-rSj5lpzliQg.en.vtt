00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
In the previous lesson, you learned about

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.144
the core idea of localization in an attuative way.

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:07.229
You also did localization quizzes in Python.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.150
As Sebastian already told you,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.449
multiplication and addition solves the localization problem,

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.625
and localization is a foundation for autonomous driving.

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:16.980
Now, you will learn more about

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.899
the whole underlying math behind such a localization problem.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.429
This means I will teach you the derivation of

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.370
the base localization filter called Markov Localization,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.429
which is one of the most common localization frameworks.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.829
In parallel, you will also learn to implement the math directly with C++.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.280
I'll also talk about the motion and observation model.
