00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.104
In this case, the law of total probability will help you a lot,

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.945
so this has nothing to do with Bayes Rule.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.300
You already heard about this important rule from Sebastian.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.179
Do you remember? And here,

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.724
we can see as a result,

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:18.420
we introduce a state xt minus one and assume the state is given.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.990
Then, the probability distribution of our motion model can be expressed as the

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:32.504
integral of pxt given the previous states,

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.770
the previous observations are controls,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.200
the map multiplied by the probability distribution of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.050
the previous state itself over the whole state space xt minus one.

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:53.780
For better understanding, assume you are only half p of xt and you introduce pxt minus 1.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.425
Then, you would have inside the integral pxt,

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:06.539
given xt minus one and the probability distribution of pxt minus one itself.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.670
And this is exactly the same as the example over here.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.739
But since we have conditions in our target distribution,

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:17.789
you also have to consider them in the first and second tab.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.160
So, let us represent this situation as

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.909
a graph to visualize the dependencies between the road blocks,

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.484
because of introducing xt minus one.

00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:30.090
You are looking at all possible states of the previous time step

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.960
and then predict where the car would be in the next time step.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:38.804
Since we also have all the other given values over here,

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:41.850
we also use this information to estimate xt.

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:49.079
The same information is also use to estimate xt minus one itself.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.530
And of course, xt minus one is unknown.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.049
Now, my question is,

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.289
could we simplify this relation by using meaningful assumptions?
