00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.185
At the beginning of this lesson,

00:00:02.185 --> 00:00:04.195
we started with using Bayes' rule.

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:07.410
The belief of x_t as a normalized ether,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.050
multiplied with the observation and the motion.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.545
We simplified the observation model to p of

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:20.980
z_t only given x_t and the map using the Markov Assumption.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.539
For the motion model,

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.410
we used to law of total probability and odds of

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.329
the Markov Assumption to get the desired recursive structure.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:36.024
The motion model includes the belief at t minus one and our transition model.

00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:41.324
Finally, the belief at x_t can be written as the following.

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:45.525
The motion model is also called the prediction step for the belief x_t

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:51.049
which can be expressed by the belief x_t covered with a little hat.

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.459
This formula represents a general base filter for localization

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.484
and is also called Markov Localization.

00:00:58.484 --> 00:01:04.394
You can also represent the filter dependencies as a graph by combining both subgraphs.

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:07.795
To estimate the new state, x_t,

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:09.510
we only take into account

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.050
the previous belief state and only the current observations and controls.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.114
The state x_t and z_t also depends on the map.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:26.769
In literature, you will often find the representation without the belief x_t.

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:30.140
There's also common practice to neglect the map and the motion model.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.849
This means, we remove the map, m,

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.530
over here and also remove the dependencies in the graph.
