00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.060
After you learn the
structure of the input data,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.240
I will talk more about the
motivation for the following

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.470
videos.

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:09.869
Up to here, there
are two problems

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:14.549
if we want to estimate
the posterior directly.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.469
The first one is the localizer
must process on each cycle

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.219
a lot of data.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:25.890
The second is the amount of
data increases over time.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.670
This won't work for
real time localizer,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.050
which should run with at least
10 hertz in our [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:37.289
In the following, I will present
a mathematical proof showing

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.359
that we can change this
so our localizer, first,

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.079
only needs to handle a
few bytes on each update,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.219
and handles the same
amount of data per update

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.600
regardless of drive time.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.260
So let's start with an overview
of what we want to achieve.
