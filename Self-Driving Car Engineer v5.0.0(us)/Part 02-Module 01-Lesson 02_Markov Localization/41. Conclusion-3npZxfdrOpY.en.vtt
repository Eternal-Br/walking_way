Good job, students.

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.349
In this lesson, you
really learned a lot.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.099
You're learned to
derive the general Bayes

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:08.879
filter, a major framework for
a lot of localization methods

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.050
which are used in
autonomous cars.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.179
You also learned to
implement the filter in C++.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.789
You can handle the 1D
localization problem,

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.429
which is really amazing.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.410
In the next lessons,
Tiffany will teach you

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.570
about complex motion models,
and a 2D localization filter

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.250
based on particle filters.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.160
So enjoy, and see you later.
