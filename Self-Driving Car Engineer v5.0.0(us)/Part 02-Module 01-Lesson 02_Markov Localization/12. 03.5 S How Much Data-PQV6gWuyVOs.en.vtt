Well, six hours drive,

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:09.434
times 3600 seconds, times 10 cycles each second,

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:13.830
times 100,000 observations for each cycle,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.625
times five data points per observation,

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:24.684
times four results in 432 gigabytes.

00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:28.919
Now you have a sense of the quantity of the data that a real car would use

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.990
if it's updates step took into account all historical observations.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.705
Later in this lesson,

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:39.765
I will show you how we can get around this limitation.

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:44.009
But for now let's get started with a toy version of one delocalizer.
