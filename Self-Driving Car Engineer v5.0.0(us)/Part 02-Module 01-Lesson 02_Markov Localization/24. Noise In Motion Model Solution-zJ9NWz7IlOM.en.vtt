00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.660
If we move with no noise--

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.900
which means the transition
model is certain--

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.380
then we would result
in C. This means

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.670
we just shift the initial
belief 10 meters to the right.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.940
No noise does not mean we
get a better precision.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.859
If we move with low noise,
the belief is spread out--

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.589
so, answer B is correct.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.660
And if we move with high noise,
the belief is very spread out

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.329
and almost looks uniform--

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.559
so answer A is correct.
