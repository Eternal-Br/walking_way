00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
Before you start coding,

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:05.754
you'll need some details to help with implementing the prediction step.

00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:07.496
At the very beginning,

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:15.330
the assumption is that the car is parked at a tree or a street lamp plus/minus one meter.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.835
This means, the car could be here,

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.855
here, here, and so on.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:27.454
The transition model is controlled only by x_t minus one and u_t.

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:32.884
Here we assume, the transition model is independent from the map.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:38.640
Remember that u_t is a direct move pointed in driving direction.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.280
The transition model is defined by

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.500
the 1D normal distribution defined by the mean u_t and sigma u_t,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.560
and we have to evaluate at position x_t minus x_t minus 1_i.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.100
Here, the sigma of u_t is one meter.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.240
The state space range is from zero to 99 meters with a one-meter step resolution.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.700
Now you have all information to implement the motion model.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.314
So, before we go back to the code,

00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:11.219
I have a small quiz for you.
