00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.589
Assume you have a 1D
space between 0 and 30 meters.

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.869
At the very beginning,
the robot or the car

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.699
has no clue where it is.

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.609
So our initial belief would
be the uniform distribution,

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:16.019
which means maximum confusion.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.820
Now we assume the car knows it
is parked closely to a tree.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.019
Then, the initial belief
would look like this.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.149
And here's my question to you.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.199
How does that belief look
like after we move 10 meters

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:39.060
to the right with no noise, with
low noise, and with high noise?

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.500
And these are the
four possible answers.
