00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
In the previous lesson, you learned about

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.424
the motion model and how to implement it in C++.

00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:08.644
Now I go back to the math and I will finalize the base filter.

00:00:08.644 --> 00:00:13.500
As a reminder, you see here again the target function with the motion model,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.550
the observation model, and our normalizer.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.795
We now learn more about the observation model.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:26.609
The observation model describes the probability distribution of the observations set, T,

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.500
given the state, x_t,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.884
our previous observations or controls, and the map.

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:38.625
You can also represent a relationship as a diagram or graph,

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:42.894
x_t is unknown and points to z_t,

00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:47.035
as well as all other values like the controls,

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:51.440
the map, and the previous observations.

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:52.705
Now my question is,

00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:55.420
could you simplify the observation model using

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.000
one of the previous mentioned strategies or assumptions?
