00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.690
Here, you can see as a result of applying Bayes' rule for the localization posterior.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.540
To define the likelihood term,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.095
we swapped the state and the observation at t,

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.778
and also take into account all other conditions.

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:16.949
The prior and the normalizer are also

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.035
conditioned by the previous observations or controls and the math.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.521
It is totally fine here to condition

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:28.409
base rule on arbitrary random variables like the controls,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.067
like our observations, and the map.

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:33.049
And please, take a look at this.

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:36.314
If you remove the additional conditions in the posterior,

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:40.229
you would end up exactly with the general Bayes' formula.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:42.584
Recall the likelihood terms observation model,

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:46.829
which describes the probability distribution of the observation vector,

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.420
t. Another assumption that a state x_t are previous observations,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.740
are controlled, and the map are given.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.885
The prior is called a motion model.

00:00:57.884 --> 00:01:04.099
It is a probability distribution of x_t given all observations from one to t minus one.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.454
All controls and the math take into account that

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:11.429
no current observations are included in the motion model.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.761
To simplify the normalization part,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.319
we define the normalizer as Ether.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:21.539
Ether is one of the original normalization term and this term is a sum of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.400
the product of the observation and the motion model over all possible states, x_t_i.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.870
This also means you only have to define

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.636
the observation and motion model to estimate the beliefs.

00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:37.909
So, let's discuss these two terms more in detail.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.390
What you see here is again the definition of the motion model.The problem here

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.125
is that we have no information where the car was before at time T minus one.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:52.049
This means, no information about the previous state, x_t minus one.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.490
Now, my question is,

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:58.000
what kind of rule or law can we use which will help us here?
