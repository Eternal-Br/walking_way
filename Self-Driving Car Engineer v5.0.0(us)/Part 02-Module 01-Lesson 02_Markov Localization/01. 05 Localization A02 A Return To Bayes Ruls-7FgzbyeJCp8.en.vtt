00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
So, let's have some fun. Let's talk about one of

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.770
my favorite algorithm all my life called Markov Localization.

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:06.614
The reason why it's favorite for me is,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.940
back in the day when I applied at Stanford for professorship,

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.529
my talk there that got me the job was actually on Markov Localization.

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.199
So it's old, I've written over 100 papers on it,

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.939
so you can write a lot of stuff off it,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.730
and now it's time for you to understand Markov Localization,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.004
the very basics of it,

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:25.439
and apply Bayesian thinking through the problem of robot localization.
