00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.945
High-performance computing, we're now ready to move into C++.

00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:09.000
Well so far, everything we've done has been in Python and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.230
Python is a great language to learn how to program computers.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.265
It's a great language to do rapid prototyping,

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.990
but it's not very good for interfacing to

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:20.719
low-level hardware and is not good for computing.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.304
It has to be very precise in its timing.

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:25.939
When you talk to self-driving car companies,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.870
most of their code is actually written in C++,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.760
because it's much more precise in its execution.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.530
So, we want you now to move into C++,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.520
but before we do this,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.700
we want you to self-diagnose what your knowledge level really is.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.530
So, we are going to start with a few questions,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.835
you don't have to answer them,

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:48.679
but if you have a hard time answering those questions,

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.799
you might want to brush up a little bit before you dive into the Hallstein C++.
