This is a task often performed by a functional safety manager.\n\nOnce you understand the motivation behind documentation, you will learn about the different parts of a safety plan:\n* Safety Culture \n* Safety Lifecycle\n* Safety Management Roles and Responsibilities\n* Development Interface Agreements\n* Confirmation Measures\n\nWhile a lot of these terms might seem foreign, you will become familiar with them as you progress through this lesson and the rest of the module.\n\nSome parts of the safety plan are more intuitive than others. For example, the **project schedule plan** would be a calendar. Filling out much of the **confirmation measures** section, on the other hand, requires knowledge about testing and verification that goes beyond what's covered in the module.\n\nPart 2 of the ISO 26262 standard, *Management of Functional Safety*, defines the safety plan.\n\nNote that Safety Culture, Safety Lifecycle, Development Interface Agreements, and Confirmation Measures are important safety plan elements, but are not part of the work product called \"safety plan\" defined by ISO 26262.  Rather, they are considered separate work products.  ISO 26262 allows tailored safety plan processes which includes multiple work products.",

Auditors will rely on the documentation to assess your work.  An audit may be followed by a safety assessment, used to determine if the decisions made and steps taken achieve appropriate safety.  \n\nDocumentation also provides a reference when modifying a system. If, for example, you are modifying a brake system, you can use prior documentation to help guide the current project.\n\nWhat happens if the vehicle you helped design is being sold to the public and then has a safety issue? Government authorities will probably expect to see documentation for how the system was designed and tested. You'll want to prove that you followed best practices. The proof is in the documentation.\n\nThe main goal in functional safety is to reduce risk to acceptable levels. But how do you prove that your design solutions actually lower risks? Much like a lawyer would argue a case in court, you would provide your arguments in a final document called a **safety case**.\n\nA safety case would provide evidence that your project has made the vehicle safer.\n\nThe evidence would include all the ISO 26262 documentation such as the safety plan, design plans, functional safety concept, technical safety concepts, as well as evidence documenting testing and integration.\n\nThe safety case would discuss what elements you added to the system in order to make it safe. And it would provide testing evidence that shows the system functioning properly. The documentation provides evidence that what you added to the system really does make the vehicle safer. Somebody who is completely independent from the functional safety team should evaluate the validity of the safety case.",

That’s because HARA is the critical first step in identifying high risk situations.\n\nOn the other hand, a person who develops a system that is rated low risk can be on the same team as the person who reviews the system for ISO 26262 compliance.\n",

We are going to look at an advanced driver assistance system throughout the functional safety lessons, and you will use what you've learned about that system to make your documents. Let's go over the parts that you'll be expected to complete:\n\n*Purpose of the Safety Plan*\n\nIn your own words, you will describe the purpose of the safety plan.\n\n*Item Definition*\n\nAn item definition describes which system is being considered for the functional safety analysis. We'll talk about item definition more in the lesson \"Functional Safety Concept\".\n\n*Goals and Measures*\n\nYou will be expected to describe the goal of the project. Think about what the goal is of functional safety and how that goal relates to the project.\n\n*Safety Culture*\n\nPretend that you work for a company looking into the functional safety of the advanced driver assistance system. You'll describe the characteristics of your company's safety culture. \n\n*Safety Lifecycle Tailoring*\n\nYou will discuss which parts of the functional safety standard are in scope for this project.\n\n*Development Interface Agreement*\n\nWhile you will not need to create a development interface agreement, you will be asked to describe the agreement's purpose. You will also need to differentiate between what your company is in charge of and what other companies are in charge of for the advanced driver assistance system.\n\n*Confirmation Measures*\n\nYou will be asked to describe the purpose of confirmation measures. You will also be asked to define terms like confirmation review, functional safety audit, and functional safety assessment.\n\nTake a look at this link, [safety plan template file](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Functional-Safety-Project/tree/master/Template_Files), to see the safety plan template we are providing for the project.\n",
