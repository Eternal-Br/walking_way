Remember that requirements define what the vehicle needs to do; in other words, requirements define the vehicle's functions..\n\nYou need to allocate these safety requirements to the relevant parts of the system diagram. Allocation means defining which part of the system architecture will implement each requirement. This could involve expanding the system architecture with new element blocks.\n\nYou will then refine the system architecture to handle the new requirements.\n\nFunctional safety requirements also have a few attributes that need to be specified in the functional safety concept:\n- the ASIL level\n- the fault tolerant time interval, which measures how quickly a system needs to react to a hazardous situation\n- And the safe state, which discusses what a system looks like after it has avoided an accident\n\nWe are also going to discuss verification and validation, which is how you prove that a system actually meets your requirements.\n\nAll of this information will go into the functional safety concept.",

The functional safety concept and technical safety concept are similar in that you will need to identify new requirements and allocate these requirements to system diagrams. \n\nThe difference is that the functional safety concept is looking at the item from a higher level. In the technical safety concept, you will start thinking about sensors, control units and actuators. Technical safety requirements are general hardware and software requirements but still without getting into specific details. For example, in the technical safety concept you might realize that you need to add more ECUs, sensors, and extra software blocks to your system. \n\nYou will see in this lesson that the functional safety concept does not go into technical details. The functional safety concept looks at the general functionality of the item; the technical safety concept looks at the technical implementation of the item. In practice, developing these two documents is an iterative process where new functional requirements could lead to new technical requirements which could lead back to new functional requirements. ",

              "text": "### Functional Safety Analysis\n\nBefore we derive safety requirements, let's talk about malfunctions. We've said that the main purpose or function of the lane departure warning and lane keeping assistance is to provide vibrational steering feedback and torque to the driver as haptic feedback. And we had a safety goal to limit the oscillating torque.\n\nWhat would be a malfunction for this? One approach is to use guide words.  ISO 26262 does not provide guidewords, however companies often use these as part of their guidelines. Some example guidewords for this case are:\n\n* NO\n* WRONG\n* EARLY\n* MORE\n* LESS\n\nSo in the case of the lane departure warning, \"MORE\" seems like an appropriate guide word; the lane departure warning is giving MORE torque than what is safe. There would be two malfunctions. The oscillating amplitude is too high and the oscillating frequency is too high. Formally, the malfunctions would be:\n\n\"The lane departure warning function applies an oscillating torque with very high torque amplitude (above limit)\"\n\n\"The lane departure warning function applies an oscillating torque with very high torque frequency (above limit)\"\n\nFor the lane keeping assistance function, \"NO\" would be an appropriate guide word. The lane keeping assistance keeps the vehicle centered in the lane. The malfunction would be that the assistance has no time limit. The malfunction would be:\n\n\"The lane keeping assistance function is not limited in time duration which leads to misuse as an autonomous driving function.\"\n\nNotice that the information in the functional safety analysis comes from the hazard analysis and risk assessment. While this exercise might seem trivial, imagine having hundreds of functions each with various malfunctions. The guide words help to analyze functions and malfunctions methodically. These malfunctions are then converted into functional safety requirements",

We determined a safety goal saying the \"lane keeping assistance function shall be time limited and the additional steering torque shall end after a given timer interval so that the driver can not misuse the system for autonomous driving\". In other words, the lane assistance system should stop applying extra torque after a certain amount of time.\n\nIn this example as well, we can still meet the safety requirement by merely adding functionality to the power steering ECU. For the lane keeping assistance function, we'll define a new requirement that \"the electronic power steering ECU shall ensure that the lane keeping assistance torque is applied for only Max_Duration\".\n",

The lane keeping item shall ensure that the lane departure oscillating torque frequency is below Max_Torque_Frequency\n\nFor safety goal number 2, you derived a functional safety requirement that \"the electronic power steering ECU shall ensure that the lane keeping assistance torque is applied for only Max_Duration\". \n\nYour next step will be to figure out where these requirements belong in the system architecture.\n",

Let's just say after some user testing that we decide to limit the vibrational torque to +/- 3 N-m. Anything beyond +/- 3 N-m was too difficult for drivers to control. \n\nMaybe we'll put in a buffer and say that the \"normal lane assistance functionality software block\" will ask for a torque of +/- 2.8 N-m. \n\nThe \"safety lane assistance functionality\" block's only job is to make sure the torque does not go beyond +/- 3 N-m. \n\nSo you could program the \"normal\" block to only make requests between +/- 2.8 N-m. The \"safety\" block is then adding an extra check to make sure the request never goes beyond +/- 3 N-m. If the torque request goes beyond +/- 3 N-m, the safety software block will assume something has gone wrong with the system. The safety software block might not know why the malfunction occurred or what the source was. But the safety software block knows that something has gone wrong.\n\nWhy would the \"normal\" block ever request a torque beyond +/- 2.8 N-m? Two sources could be either a software bug or an ECU hardware component failure. Maybe an electrical short circuit could cause the malfunction as well.\n\nThe benefit of the ASIL decomposition is that the \"normal\" block, which will have functionality for receiving and interpreting camera subsystem signals, only needs to go through quality management protocols; otherwise, all of that functionality would have to go through the extra rigors of ASIL C testing.",

And what is its ASIL?\n\nLet's go back to the safety goal and functional safety requirements for the lane keeping function:\n\nFrom the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment, the safety goal was the \"lane keeping assistance function shall be time limited and the additional steering torque shall end after a given timer interval so that the driver can not misuse the system for autonomous driving\". We rated this ASIL B.\n\nWe then derived the functional safety requirement: \"the lane keeping item shall ensure that the lane keeping assistance torque is applied for only Max_Duration\".\n\nThe functional safety requirement inherits the ASIL from the safety goal, so this functional safety requirement is ASIL B as well.\n\nWhat do we do now? We already decided that the lane departure warning made the lane assistance software block ASIL C. But we also have a functional safety requirement with ASIL B for the same software block. If two safety requirements are assigned to the same block, the higher ASIL prevails. So the simplest answer is that the lane assistance software block would have ASIL C.\n\nThe rule in ISO 26262 is that sub-elements should inherit the highest ASIL level unless you can prove that the lower ASIL sub-element has no impact on and does not cause a failure in the higher ASIL sub-element. This is called criteria for co-existence. If you can prove that the lane keeping assistance software would not affect the lane departure warning, then you can separate out the functionality into two blocks with ASIL C and ASIL B.\n",

Because the system is now time limited, the driver will be unable to misuse the system as if it were fully autonomous, and will be more likely to keep their hands on the wheel at all times. If the lane keeping assistance function goes beyond the time limit and keeps turning the vehicle towards the center of the lane, the driver could still remain in control of the car.

So if the system has a malfunction, we can shut the system down; on the other hand, a functioning motor is necessary for driving a vehicle.

You would do this on the right side of the V model during validation, verification and testing. \n\nBut in the functional safety concept, you can specify the criteria and methods that will be used later for verification, validation and testing of your functional safety requirements.\n\nFor example, we have set a limit on the maximum amplitude allowed in the lane departure warning functionality.\n\nFor whatever value we end up choosing for the max torque amplitude, we need to **validate** that we chose a reasonable value. We would need to test how drivers react to different torque amplitudes and frequencies to prove that we chose an appropriate value.\n\nOnce we have validated our choice, we then need to **verify** that the safety requirement is met; when the torque amplitude crosses the limit, the lane assistance output is set to zero within the 50 ms fault tolerant time interval. For this specific case, we would probably do a software test inserting a fault into the system and seeing what happens.\n\nFor the lane keeping assistance function, we would have to test and validate that the max_duration chosen really did dissuade drivers from taking their hands off the wheel. Then we would verify that the system really does turn off if the lane keeping assistance every exceeded max_duration.\n\n",
