The item definition describes which vehicle system is under consideration. Part of the definition includes the system boundaries clarifying what is inside versus outside the system. \n\n**Situational Analysis**\n\nIn a situational analysis, you choose different driving scenarios like driving on a bumpy road, being towed, and driving on the freeway. \n\n**Hazard Identification**\n\nThis is where you figure out what could go wrong with your system: in other words, how the system could malfunction. Remember that ISO 26262 only looks at electrical and electronic malfunctions. An electronic parking brake failure, for example, could be a potential malfunction.\n\n**Hazardous Event Classification According to Exposure, Severity and Controllability**\n\nYou then combine situations and hazards together. Essentially, you take a malfunction and then think about the malfunction under different driving scenarios. Like if the electronic parking brake failed while the vehicle was parked on a steep hill.\n\nYou can then calculate three metrics called exposure, severity and controllability. The values for these three metrics will depend on the hazard, the driving scenario and what might happen when the hazard occurs under the scenario.\n\n**ASIL**\n\nAfter you have calculated exposure, severity and controllability, you can now determine the ASIL. There is a table to facilitate this calculation.\n\n**Safety Goal**\n\nFinally, you derive safety goals based on the hazard analysis and risk assessment. A safety goal is a type of engineering requirement specifically for vehicle functional safety; for example, \"The electronic parking brake system shall always be engaged when the vehicle is in park on a gradient that is greater than 10 degrees\".

              "text": "### Lane Assistance System Functionality\n\nFor the functional safety module, we are going to look at a simplified version of a Lane Assistance System. \n\nWe want to make sure that you understand how the technology works and what the system architecture looks like.\n\nThe Lane Assistance System will have two functions:\n1. Lane departure warning\n2. Lane keeping assistance\n\nWhen the driver drifts towards the edge of the lane, two things will happen:\n* the **lane departure warning function** will vibrate the steering wheel\n* the **lane keeping assistance function** will move the steering wheel so that the wheels turn towards the center of the lane \n\nTo state the **lane departure warning** engineering requirement more formally: \"the lane departure warning function shall apply an oscillating steering torque to provide the driver a haptic feedback.\" In other words, the vehicle quickly moves the steering wheel back and forth to create a vibration. You can assume that the engineering requirement came from a product engineering team, and your job will be to add extra requirements to ensure functional safety.\n\nThe **lane keeping assistance functionality** will automatically **assist** the driver; the steering wheel turns towards the center of the lane. We will formally list the requirement as \"the lane keeping assistance function shall apply the steering torque when active in order to stay in ego lane\". Ego lane refers to the lane in which the vehicle currently drives. \n\nWhen the camera senses that the vehicle is leaving the lane, the camera sends a signal to the electronic power steering system asking to turn and vibrate the steering wheel.\n\nThe camera sensor will also request that a warning light turn on in the car display dashboard. That way the driver knows that the lane assistance system is active. \n\nWhat if the driver wants to leave the lane? If the driver uses a turn signal, then the lane assistance system deactivates so that the vehicle can leave the lane. The driver can also turn off the system completely with a button on the dashboard.\n\nThe driver is still expected to have both hands on the steering wheel at all times. The electronic power steering subsystem has a sensor to detect how much the driver is already turning. The lane keeping assistance function will merely add the extra torque required to get the car back towards center. The extra torque is applied directly to the steering wheel via a motor.\n",

In the system outline in red, we have two sensors: a camera sensor and a driver steering torque sensor. The ECUs are the controllers, and the actuator is the motor that turns the steering wheel. The sensors, ECUs, and motor would all be considered **elements**. **Element** is a generic term for any part of a system.

The driver is on a country road and misusing the system. That combination probably does not happen often, so we will label the exposure E2. \n\nThe malfunction was that the lane keeping assistance was always on and had no time limit, so drivers could take both hands off the wheel. Because hands aren't on the wheel at high speeds, a vehicle accident would not be controllable. We will label this hazardous situation as C3.",

              "text": "### Examples of How Driving Situations Affect ASIL\n\nTo reinforce how severity, exposure, and controllability relate to ASIL, let's look at the lane departure warning example one more time. In the original situational analysis, we said that the vehicle was driving on the highway in the rain at high speed, which led to ASIL C.\n\nWhat about driving on a wet road on a city street at low speed? A low speed collision implies severity of S1. Exposure remains E3 because of the wet road. Controllability would could still remain C3 because the steering wheel jerking back and forth violently would be difficult to control even at lower speeds. S1, E3 and C3 result in ASIL A. The ASIL went down to A whereas originally we had ASIL C. Intuitively, this makes sense; the driver is driving more slowly with all other conditions remaining the same, so the risk has gone down.\n\nWhat about driving on a dry road on a city street at low speed? Severity would stay at S1. Exposure now increases to E4 and controllability remains at C3. ASIL now increases to B. Perhaps counterintuitively, if we consider driving on a dry road instead of a wet road, risk increases. The increased risk comes from the exposure. A driver is more likely to be driving on a dry road than a wet road, so there is a higher probability that a random malfunction will occur on a dry road; hence risk increases for the dry road scenario.\n\nWhat if we had considered high speed highway driving on a dry road? Exposure would go up to E4, severity would be S3, and controllability C3. The ASIL would then increase to ASIL D. \n\nWhen more than one situation maps to the same hazard, you will be conservative and choose the highest ASIL level for the hazard. If we were considering the possibility that the lane departure warning system vibrates too much on wet highways and also dry highways, we would assign ASIL  D. ",

So in the lane assistance example, the first hazardous situation with ASIL C will require more work than the second hazardous situation with ASIL B.\n\nHere are a few examples of extra measures that may need to be taken for higher ASILs:\n\n* Deductive analysis, an example of which is [Fault Tree Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis) is recommended for ASIL C and ASIL D\n* ASIL D suggests a target for the PMHF metric failure rate of no greater than 10 dangerous, undetected failures per billion hours of operation whereas ASIL B only suggests a failure rate of no more than 100 failures per billion hours\n* For Software units with ASIL D more rigorous testing such as [MC/DC coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage) are highly recommended whereas ASIL B only mandates DC coverage.\n\nCompensatory measures like Fault Tree Analysis, and MC/DC coverage are beyond the scope of this module, but you can learn more about them at the links.",
