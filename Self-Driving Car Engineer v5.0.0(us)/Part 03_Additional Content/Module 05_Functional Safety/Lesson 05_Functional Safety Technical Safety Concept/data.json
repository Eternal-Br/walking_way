The product development phase also includes designing hardware and software. This lesson will only focus on the technical safety concept, and the next lesson will discuss hardware and software development.\n\nAs a reminder, here is a version of the V model that has been stretched out vertically.

The anti-lock brake ECU might share vehicle speed data with the power steering ECU. We are not going to expand on this example in the rest of the lesson. But if you want to challenge yourself, consider expanding on this idea in the final project. \n\nImagine that the lane keeping assistance function does not take driver speed into account when deciding how much torque to apply. This could lead to a potentially hazardous situation where the system turns the wheel too abruptly at a high vehicle speed. Or the lane keeping assistance provides too much extra torque on a sharp curve. The driver could lose control of the vehicle. So this idea could be part of a hazard and risk analysis, which would lead to a safety goal. Then you'd derive functional safety requirements from the safety goal. And finally you'd derive technical safety requirements from the functional safety requirements.",

The truth is, most of the technical safety requirements already derived would also be relevant to the two other functional safety requirements.

A qualifier can then be added as well, which is a signal indicating whether or not a signal is valid. The CRC ensures the data that is sent out by one element is the same data received by another element.\n\nAnother common mechanism is an alive counter. An alive counter checks that the signal is new and not an old signal; an alive counter increases the count every time a signal goes out.\n\nCRCs and alive counters can be used together to guarantee correct transmission. The final lesson on software requirements will also discuss a specific CRC protocol in more depth.",

So if the same software element provides functionality to the lane departure warning and lane keeping assistance functions, the higher ASIL wins. In this case, the lane departure warning had ASIL C whereas the lane keeping assistant had ASIL B. So ASIL C wins.\n* If an element contains subelements with different ASILs, both sub-elements receive the highest ASIL. If a subelement has an ASIL but another subelement is QM, then the same rule applies and both will take the highest ASIL. The exception is if the criteria for coexistence is met. Criteria for coexistence was already discussed in the previous lesson. If a failure in one sub-element will not affect the other sub-element, then the sub-elements can have different ASILs.\n* Internal and external interfaces for safety-related elements need to be clearly defined. This way non-safety related elements are clearly identified as well. \n",
