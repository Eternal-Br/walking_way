00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Great. You now know how to model the dynamics for a vehicle.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.230
One last thing before we move on, actuator constraints.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.600
In a real vehicle, actuators are limited by

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.434
the design of the vehicle in fundamental physics.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.984
For example, a vehicle can't have a steering angle of 90 degrees. It's impossible.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:20.875
Thus, it doesn't make sense for us to even consider these kinds of inputs.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:23.960
There's actually a vocabulary for describing this constraint.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.690
We call this model nonholonomic,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.464
because the vehicle can't move in arbitrary directions.

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:31.230
It's limited by its steering angle constraints.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.605
We can solve this by setting lower and upper bounds for the actuators.

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:39.179
For example, we may set the steering angle to be between minus 30 and 30 degrees,

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.030
and the acceleration to be between minus one and one.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.969
Minus one signifying full brake,

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.259
and one signifying full acceleration.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:48.659
In practice, the upper and lower bounds

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.349
should mimic the actual vehicle as closely as possible.
