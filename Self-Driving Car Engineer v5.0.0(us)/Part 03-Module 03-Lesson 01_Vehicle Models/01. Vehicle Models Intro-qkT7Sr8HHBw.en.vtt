00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.919
One approach to writing a good controller is to

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.125
first model the vehicle's dynamics and constraints.

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:10.054
That way, we can analyze and tune the controller more efficiently.

00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:12.289
In this lesson, you'll learn about vehicle models.

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.129
The models describe mathematically how the vehicle moves,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.125
some models being more realistic than others.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:21.390
Typically, more realistic models are also more complex and more challenging to work with,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.719
so there's always a trade-off to make.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:27.250
You'll work with a relatively simple type of model, the kinematic model.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.464
Kinematic models ignore many elements like gravity and tire forces,

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:35.424
but they're relatively simple to work with and they often perform well.

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.089
You'll also learn about dynamic models,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.580
which capture more realistic forces and accelerations.
