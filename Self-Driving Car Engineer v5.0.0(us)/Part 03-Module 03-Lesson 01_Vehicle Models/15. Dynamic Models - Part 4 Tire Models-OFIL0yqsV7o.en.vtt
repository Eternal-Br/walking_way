00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.099
Tire models aim to model the behavior of the tire as closely as possible.

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:06.958
For example, the lateral force generated looks something like

00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:11.070
this: alpha is this slip angle and F is a lateral force.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.009
Race car drivers have a fantastic mental model of this graph and can

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.085
usually capture optimal longitudinal or lateral force for the situation.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.010
The slip angle is just one component used to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.809
calculate the longitudinal and lateral forces of tires.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.144
There is a breadth of literature dedicated to the study of tire dynamics.

00:00:26.143 --> 00:00:28.919
We could have an entire course just on tire forces.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.559
The most popular model is the Pacejka tire model,

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.579
also known as the Magic Tire Formula.
