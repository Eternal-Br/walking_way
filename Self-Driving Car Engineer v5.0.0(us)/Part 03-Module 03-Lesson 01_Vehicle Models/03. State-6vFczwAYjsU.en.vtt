00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Think about how to keep track of the state of a vehicle.

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:06.634
The vehicle is located at a position which we track with x and y.

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:08.025
If we're talking about a car,

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:11.714
then the vehicle also has an orientation which we'll denote with cy.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:13.679
This is a good model of a stationary vehicle,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.778
but what if our vehicle is in motion?

00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:18.018
In that case, it will also have a velocity which we'll call

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.419
v. This captures the vehicle's state.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.940
So the next task is to model how that state evolves through time.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.589
If we know the current state of the vehicle,

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:27.398
can we tell where we'll be in the future?
