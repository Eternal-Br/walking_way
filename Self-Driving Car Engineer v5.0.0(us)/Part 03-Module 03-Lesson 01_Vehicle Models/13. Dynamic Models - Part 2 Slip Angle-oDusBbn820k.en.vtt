00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.729
The slip angle can be interpreted as the angle between

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:06.599
the velocity vector of the wheel and the orientation of the wheel itself.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:09.929
You're probably familiar with the sound of a tire squealing in a parking lot.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.650
That's a result of having a slip angle.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.400
The slip angle can be expressed as the arc tangent of

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.000
the wheel longitudinal velocity divided by the wheel lateral velocity.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.024
The force generated by the slip angle is actually how a vehicle turns.

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:24.899
Otherwise, inertia would carry the vehicle off the road.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.910
Different tires have different characteristics though.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.000
Racing tires generate much more force from the same slip angle than conventional tires.
