00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.669
Congratulations, you're now familiar with kinematic and dynamic vehicle models.

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:05.830
These models along with

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.129
the actuator constraints are the foundations of model predictive control.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.220
What we've built so far is a model that describes the future trajectory of the vehicle.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.899
In order to develop an optimal controller,

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.940
we need to define a cost function that captures the errors we want to minimize.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.980
The cost function will require you to use

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.920
the model to predict where the vehicle will go into the future.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.590
The cost is actually the difference between where you want the vehicle

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.524
to go and where you predict it will go based on that model.

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:33.379
That's what's it's called Model Predictive Control.
