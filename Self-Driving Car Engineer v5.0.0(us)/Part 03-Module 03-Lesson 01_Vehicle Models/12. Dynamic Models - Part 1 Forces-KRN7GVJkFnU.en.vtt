00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
The vehicle dynamics models -- the complex interactions

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.474
between the tires and the road -- determine the motion of the vehicle.

00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:09.573
We don't delve too heavily into the mathematical details here.

00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:12.585
Rather we'll focus more on the intuition of what these forces do.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.609
While there are many forces to consider in a dynamic model,

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.698
they essentially boil down to longitudinal and lateral forces acting on the vehicle.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.559
Think of the longitudinal force as a force pushing the vehicle forward or

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:26.254
backward and lateral force is a force pushing the vehicle side to side.

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:28.184
Tires play a huge role here.

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:32.250
The longitudinal and lateral force on the vehicle is the sum of the forces on the tires.
