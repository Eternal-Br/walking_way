00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
The slip ratio comes up when there's a mismatch between the speed

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.634
of the vehicle wheel and the expected longitudinal velocity.

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:09.300
This means, in addition to the tire's natural rolling motion,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.788
there's also a slipping motion.

00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:14.490
Similarly to how the slip angle's required to generate lateral force,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.129
the slip ratio is required to generate longitudinal force.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:21.100
In either case, all of this begins when the contact patch of the tire meets the road.
