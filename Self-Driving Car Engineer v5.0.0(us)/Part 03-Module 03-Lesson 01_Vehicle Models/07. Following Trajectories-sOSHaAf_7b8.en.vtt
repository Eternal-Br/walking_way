00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
Autonomous vehicle system architecture starts with the perception system,

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:05.189
which estimates the state of

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.993
the surrounding environment including landmarks and vehicles and pedestrians.

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:12.990
The localization block compares a model to a map to figure out where the vehicle is.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.649
The path planning block charts a trajectory using environmental model,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.690
the map and vehicle location.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.854
Finally, the control loop applies the actuators to follow this trajectory.

00:00:21.853 --> 00:00:23.910
Typically, the path planning block passes

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.969
the reference trajectory to the control block as a polynomial.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.000
Third degree polynomials are common so they can fit most roads.
