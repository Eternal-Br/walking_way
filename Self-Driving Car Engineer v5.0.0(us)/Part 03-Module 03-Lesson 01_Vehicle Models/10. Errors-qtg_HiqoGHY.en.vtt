00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
A controller actuates the vehicle to follow

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.650
the reference trajectory within a set of design requirements.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.950
One important requirement is to minimize the area between

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.984
the reference trajectory and the vehicle's actual path.

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:14.669
You can minimize this error by predicting the vehicle's actual path and then adjusting

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.859
the control inputs to minimize the difference between

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.263
that prediction and the reference trajectory.

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:23.129
That's how to use a kinematic model to predict the vehicle's future state.

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.199
Next, you'll define the predicted area between

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.010
the trajectory and that predicted path of the vehicle.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.760
Once you've predicted the error you can actuate

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.000
with the vehicle to minimize the error over time.
