00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.229
Conceptually,
localization

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:03.879
is pretty straightforward.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.580
A robot takes information
about its environment

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.550
and compares that to
information it already

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.950
knows about the real world.

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.259
Humans do something similar.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.545
Imagine you were suddenly
kidnapped and blindfolded.

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:21.280
You are stuffed into a
car that drove for hours.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.660
You would have no idea
where in the world you were.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.800
Then, the blindfold were
removed and you saw like this.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.890
Now, what would you say if
you were asked, where are you?
