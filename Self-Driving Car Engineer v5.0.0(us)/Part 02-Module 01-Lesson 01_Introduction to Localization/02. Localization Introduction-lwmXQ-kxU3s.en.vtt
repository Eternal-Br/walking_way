00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.359
Hi I'm Tiffany, and I'm
a self-driving car engineer

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:04.740
at Mercedes-Benz.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.108
I work on the localization team
and by the end of this module,

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.650
you'll have a good
understanding of what I do.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.850
At the moment we are in
our Garage at MBRDNA.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.390
Hi.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.160
My name is
Maximilian, and I also

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.679
work on self-driving
cars at Mercedes-Benz

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.000
as part of the localization
team in Sunnyvale.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.839
In the previous lessons you
learned about sensor fusion

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.309
and how to combine
different sensor

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.559
readings like lidar
and radar data

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.419
with the help of common filters.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.660
You also learned how to
write complex code in C++,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.969
which will be necessary to
be successful in the field

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.320
of autonomous driving.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.000
Today you will learn
about localization.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.030
Localization is what
allows an autonomous car

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.920
to know precisely where it is.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.920
It's an amazing topic, and I
love working in this field.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.079
And of course, localization
is really important

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.640
to drive autonomously.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.490
Without localization it would
be impossible for a self-driving

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.190
car to drive safely.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.409
At the end also localization
lesson you will be able

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.889
to implement high performance
localization software and C++

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.149
for autonomous cars.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.159
So, what is localization?

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.060
That's what we are
going to cover next.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.230
So let's dive in.
