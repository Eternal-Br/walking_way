00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.660
Now that you know what
localization is in general,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.880
here's what will be happening
in the next lessons.

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.209
In the first part, you will
learn in an intuitive way

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:08.910
what localization is.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.710
You will do also
a lot of quizzes,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160
and you will also implement
the first localization system

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.179
in Python.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.670
Then, we will go deeper in
the math of Bayesian filters

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.270
and implement a
1D example in C++.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.640
After that, we'll
dive into motion models.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.810
And finally, you'll implement
your own 2D particle filter

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:26.070
in C++.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.140
Pretty cool, right?
