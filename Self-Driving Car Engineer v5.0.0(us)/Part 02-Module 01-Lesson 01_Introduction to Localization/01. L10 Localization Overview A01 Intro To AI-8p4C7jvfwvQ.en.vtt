00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
So, my interest in self-driving cars started with

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.050
the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004 in which my team at Stanford developed Stanley,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.005
a robot that could drive itself through the Mojave Desert.

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.100
The vehicle was based on a Volkswagen Touareg,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.330
was equipped with all kinds of sensors,

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.029
like GPS and laser.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.569
It was able to make its own decisions without any human input whatsoever.

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:30.945
The DARPA Grand Challenge was a government-sponsored race that took place in 2005.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.435
Here, we see our robot, Stanley,

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:37.310
moving through deserts completely without a human on board.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.289
The task was to drive a desert trail for about 130 miles.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.314
Whoever was fastest would win the race.

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:46.339
He look passing a different robot by

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.140
Carnegie Mellon University about a 110 miles into the race.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.274
Our robot was able to navigate with these steep,

00:00:54.274 --> 00:01:00.670
mountainous roads and able to avoid collisions with rocks or falling down a cliff,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.810
all based on its ability to use what I'm going to teach you in this class.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.340
After almost seven hours and 131 miles,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.250
everybody returned all the way to the starting base as

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.790
the first robot to ever finish a DARPA Grand Challenge,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.385
winning Stanford University two million bucks,

00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:24.205
and Stanley, a place in the Smithsonian Museum of American History.

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:30.394
This work led to the Urban Challenge in which we build another robot called Junior,

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:32.250
that eventually took second place.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.064
The Urban Challenge was a follow-up raised by DARPA,

00:01:35.064 --> 00:01:37.590
which cars were asked to drive in traffic.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.260
So, whereas the Grand Challenge was kind of a motionless desert floor,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.800
this was a mock urban city where the Rover was able to

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.629
interact with other traffic and had to follow

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:50.439
traffic rules as in this left turn over here.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.109
Had to be able to stay on lanes with very high precision,

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.980
accommodate oncoming traffic and just drive

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.409
confidently in a situation that resemble the small city.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.750
This led at Google to a sequence of experiments known as the Google self-driving car.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.969
I believe these are the best robotic cars out there today.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.120
Here we see one of our Priuses on University Avenue in Palo Alto,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.110
undetected driving just like a human driver,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.275
but this car is driving by itself.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:26.245
Our cars have been able to drive hundreds of thousands of miles,

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.335
all across California and some of Nevada,

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:32.195
in downtown areas like San Francisco,

00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:37.794
on busy highways, here in Monterey,

00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:42.179
as well a coastal city in California with lots and lots of pedestrians.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.340
These are all completely self-driving moments where the car is

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.629
able to accommodate things like deers in the headlight in the middle of the night,

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:59.219
or even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco as shown in this video.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.104
This is what I'm doing on my day job.

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:04.979
I really love- with my team,

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.894
building self-driving cars, we believe it's going to be change the world.

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:14.960
In this class, that's what I hope to enable you to do. So, let's dive in.
