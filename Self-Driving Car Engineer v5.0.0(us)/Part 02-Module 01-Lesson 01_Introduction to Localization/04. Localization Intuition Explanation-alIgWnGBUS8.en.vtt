00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.270
If you recognized
this as the Eiffel Tower,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.109
then you will probably say
something like Paris or France.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.089
This may not seem
very impressive,

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.160
but it's actually remarkable.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.289
Before the blindfold
was removed,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.549
you had zero understanding of
where you were in the world.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.800
You could have made a
guess, but you would have

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.990
had no idea if you were right.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:27.029
But after being shown a tiny
amount of data, a single image,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.299
you reduce that uncertainty
to a few kilometer radius.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:37.250
This is the main intuition
behind localization.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.399
A robot gathers information
about its current environment

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.019
and compares that to a
known map to understand

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.130
where it is in the world.
