00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.550
Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.950
Welcome to the lesson four.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.679
In this lesson, you're going
to review vehicle movement

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.073
and motion models
so that you can

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.740
predict where your
self-driving car will

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.810
be at some future time.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.310
I'm really excited
about this lesson

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.530
because I love making
robots intelligent,

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.599
and predicting
motion is a big step

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.620
for making a mobile
robot drive itself.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.990
Motion models are an important
part of many localization

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.409
algorithms.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.500
For example, in
Bayesian methods,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.539
motion models are used
in the predictive step

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.549
you learned about previously.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.000
After this lesson, you'll be
able to apply a bicycle model

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.159
to estimate the position
of the car given

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.000
sensor data such as the number
of wheel turns, velocity,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.399
and/or the yaw rate.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.859
Now let's get started
with some physics.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.170
In order to predict
the location of a car,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.750
you need to take into
account the way cars move,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.130
and for that we have the
bicycle motion model.
