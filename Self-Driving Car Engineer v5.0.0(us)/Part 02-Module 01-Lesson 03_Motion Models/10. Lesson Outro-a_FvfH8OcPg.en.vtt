00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.229
Good work.

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.799
You learned a lot of cool
things in this lesson.

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.330
Now you know the assumptions
made in the bicycle motion

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.120
model, how to calculate the new
position of the car, given yaw

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:13.129
rate, velocity, and
odometry measurements.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.300
You also learned about some
limitations of odometry.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.550
Next, you'll learn about a
cool algorithm for localization

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.740
called the particle filter.
