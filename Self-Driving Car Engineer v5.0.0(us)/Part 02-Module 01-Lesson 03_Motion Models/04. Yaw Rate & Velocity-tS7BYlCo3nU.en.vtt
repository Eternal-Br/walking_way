00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
To recap what you
learned in sensor fusion,

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:07.060
a car's heading, or yaw
angle, is its orientation.

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.219
Yaw is often measured from
the x-axis in map coordinates

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.070
with counterclockwise
angles being positive.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.859
In this situation, the car's yaw
is positive pi over 4 radians.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.379
Assuming constant turn
rate and velocity,

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.410
the equations to find the new
position of the car, which

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.260
you derived previously
in the fusion module,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.070
are shown again here.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.125
These set of equations are valid
when the yaw rate, theta dot,

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.039
is equal to zero.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.070
Here, x sub f, y sub
f, and theta sub f,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.990
represent the final x position,
y position, and yaw of the car,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.490
while x sub zero, y sub
zero, and theta sub zero

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.000
represent the initial
x position, y position,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.920
and yaw of the car.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.039
Finally, v is the
velocity of the car,

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.890
and dt is the time elapsed.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.900
If the yaw rate is not zero, you
have these equations instead,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.160
which you first saw
in sensor fusion,

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.069
because you'll have to take into
account the change in the car's

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:13.469
heading as it moves.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.480
Next, I want you
to think about some

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.390
of the other possible rotations
of the vehicle besides the yaw.
