00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
Now that you know
one way to calculate the car's

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:05.939
new position, let's look at
another commonly used method

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.129
using odometry, or
motion sensor data.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.830
For mobile robots, odometry
calmly comes from wheel sensors

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.929
that measure how many times the
wheels of the vehicle or robot

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.309
have turned.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.199
For instance, the
sensor on this wheel

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.140
would tell us it
has turned twice.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.560
Given the circumference of the
wheel and this odometry data,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.479
you can measure the
distance traveled,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.120
as indicated by the red line.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.880
More specifically, the
new position of the car

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.890
is the starting
position of the car

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.120
plus the x and y components
of the odometry, multiplied

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:41.280
by the circumference
of the wheel.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.270
Awesome.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.070
With this knowledge,
next I want you

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.380
to think about when
odometry measurements might

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.120
fail to report accurate
position estimates.
