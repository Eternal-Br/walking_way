00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
Let's talk motion models.

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:05.040
Motion models are description of the physics of a vehicle.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.875
So when you have a car, for example,

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:09.289
and you give gas, it doesn't go sideways,

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.899
it goes forwards in a specific way and it might turn in circles and the math

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.785
governing how vehicles move is called a motion model.

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:19.469
Why do we have them? Well, they make it easier to predict.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.689
They also make it easier to track and do things like

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.630
localization not just prediction and now we're

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:29.780
going to dive into this by studying a motion model called the bicycle model.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.290
It's basically half of the guides like

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.679
the one we have here and one from here driving together.
