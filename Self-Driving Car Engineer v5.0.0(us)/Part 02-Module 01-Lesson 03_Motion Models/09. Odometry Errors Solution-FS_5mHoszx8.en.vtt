00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
Great!

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.629
Let's look at each of the
possible answers from the quiz.

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.750
On a slick wet road,
wheel encoder odometry

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.120
will incur large errors
because the wheels

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.189
will slip, causing
them to travel

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.949
less distance than expected.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.839
In addition, the
wheels will also

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.309
slide while braking, further
contributing to sensor errors.

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:23.829
On dry paved roads,
however, the wheels

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.859
will travel a distance
very close to the expected

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.199
circumference of the wheel.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.859
Roads with lots of bumps also
create problems for odometry

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.839
because we are assuming
the car travels

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.080
a straight distance in the
direction of its heading.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.729
In reality, with a
bumpy road, the car

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:42.639
is traveling much
of this distance

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.969
not in a straight
line, but up and down.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.699
On a road with lots of
turns, wheel odometry

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.760
works well because even
though the heading of the car

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:55.089
is changing, it's still
moving the expected distance

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.220
in the direction of its yaw.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.039
Notice that despite the fact
that the distance vectors

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.049
for this car are at
different yaw angles,

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.549
the sum of the absolute
magnitude of all the vectors

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.060
is the same as the
expected distance traveled.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.370
Now that you know how to
predict the car's motion

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.829
at the next time
step, next you'll

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.200
learn about an algorithm
for localization

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.439
called the particle filter.
