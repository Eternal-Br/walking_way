00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.940
The bicycle model is
a simple and useful way

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.250
to represent how a car moves.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.950
Like all models, it is
based on several simplifying

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.500
assumptions.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.800
First, we all ignore all
vertical dynamics of the car,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.100
so you can assume the
car only moves in 2D.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.330
This means no flying
cars, unfortunately.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.769
Next, we'll assume
that, like a bicycle,

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.079
the front wheels of
the car are connected

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.729
to the back wheels of the car by
a rigid beam with fixed length.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.940
Here, we assume that the
front two wheels act together

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.270
so they can effectively be
represented as one wheel,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.980
just like a bicycle.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:40.009
The same holds for
the two rear wheels.

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.449
Finally, we assume the car is
also controlled like a bicycle,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.350
with a steering angle theta
and some longitudinal velocity

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.600
in the direction that
the car is heading.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.969
For this car, we change
the steering angle

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.390
by pi over 8 radians,
and then the car

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.060
moves forward at a velocity
of 3 meters per second.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.090
You have just learned
how the motion of a car

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.390
can be simplified down to
something similar to a bicycle,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.400
with a bicycle motion model.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.260
Next, you'll get
reminded how to use

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.689
the yaw rate and velocity of a
car to find its new position.
