We here at Elektrobit want to thank you for taking the functional safety module.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.954
We hope that you find this knowledge useful as you develop your automotive career.

00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:11.710
Whether we work directly with Functional Safety or not,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.894
all automotive engineers need to be aware of safety and the ISO 26262 standard.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:20.074
As an automotive software engineer,

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:24.660
you will likely find yourself implementing functional safety requirements.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.329
Thank you again and good luck.
