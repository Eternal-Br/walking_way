00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
The last source of interference you will discuss is communication interference.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:07.650
In vehicle systems, software elements need to exchange

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.115
information both within ECUs and between ECUs.

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:16.135
Even if the sender and receiver have the same ASIL,

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:19.500
there is a need to protect against interference.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.454
Communication channels between software elements

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:25.604
often will have a lower ASIL or a QM rating.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:30.144
A protected communication channel will detect data transmission errors.

00:00:30.144 --> 00:00:34.799
One of the most common mechanisms for ensuring freedom from communication interference,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:38.114
is called E2E or End to End Protocol.

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:43.530
An E2E Protocol can help protect against communication falls due to hardware,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.399
software, and electromagnetic interference.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.234
The protocol checks that data was not corrupted during transmission.

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:55.469
This way, when there is data corruption that could violate the safety goal,

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.939
the vehicle can be led to a safe state.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:00.536
In the lane departure warning example,

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:03.060
we had a technical safety requirement that could be

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.655
solved with an E2E protection mechanism.

00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:10.019
One requirement was that a vanity and integrity of

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:15.599
the data transmission of the LDW torque request signal shall be ensured.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:16.881
In the text below,

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:21.250
we will show you how to refine this requirement into software safety requirements.
