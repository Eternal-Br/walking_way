00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
You have now seen some of the main concerns

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.905
on developing safety driven hardware and software.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.955
For hardware, we discussed how random faults

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:12.910
are unavoidable but must be minimized and detected.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.089
In terms of software, we went over

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.704
the basic criteria for choosing a programming language and software tools.

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:23.934
We also showed how the V-model applies to software development.

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.195
We then discussed deriving

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:28.350
software safety requirements from technical safety requirements.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.950
And then, we saw other sources of software safety requirements,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.424
such as robustness, quality,

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:36.419
and freedom from interference.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.960
The main point is to use this knowledge for reducing risks and avoiding harm.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.100
Being aware of different sources of faults allows you to make

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.510
more robust safety requirements and design safer systems.
