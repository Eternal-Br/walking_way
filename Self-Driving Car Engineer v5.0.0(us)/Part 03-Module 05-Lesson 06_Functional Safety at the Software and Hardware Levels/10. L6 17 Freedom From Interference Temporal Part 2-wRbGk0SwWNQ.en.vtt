00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Now let's discuss incorrect allocation of

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.915
execution time and incorrect execution sequence.

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:10.919
These types of temporal interference occur when software elements execute early,

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.219
late, out of order,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.405
or that take too long to execute.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:19.050
The function safety standard recommends three different mechanisms

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.170
for dealing with execution time and execution sequence faults.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.915
They are alive supervision,

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:28.559
deadline monitoring and control flow monitoring.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.489
All three of these mechanisms work with checkpoints.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.780
There are software element reports its status at the beginning and end of execution.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.870
A live supervision limits the number of times

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:44.379
a software element can execute within a given time span.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.020
When a checkpoint is reached,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.800
the system would analyze the number of times the element was executed.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:56.714
Deadline monitoring looks at how long it takes to execute a software element.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:00.080
If an element takes too long, an error has occurred.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.716
And lastly, control flow monitoring ensures

00:01:02.716 --> 00:01:06.304
that software progress is in the correct order.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:10.950
For example, the execution sequence might be out of order or

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.260
a software element gets executed in

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.800
the middle of the sequence instead of at the beginning.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.359
Separate software blocks would be included in

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.915
the system architecture to analyze the checkpoint.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:25.590
If a fault occurred that violated the safety goal,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219
then the system should transition to a safe state.
