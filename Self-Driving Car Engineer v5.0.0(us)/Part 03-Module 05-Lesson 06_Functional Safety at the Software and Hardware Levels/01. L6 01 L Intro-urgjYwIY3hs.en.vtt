00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
You might wonder why we have put so much emphasis on

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.980
systems engineering and haven't talked about hardware and software development.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.699
ISO 26262 sees functional safety as a systems engineer problem.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.109
Hardware and software are just two parts of a vehicle system.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.269
The function safety standard puts

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.519
hardware and software development at the bottom of the V diagram for a reason.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.739
This helps ensure that you have developed

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.896
your safety requirements while taking into account the vehicle as a whole,

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:32.609
otherwise we could miss potential hazards.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.859
In this lesson, we are going to give

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.000
a broad overview of hardware and software development.
