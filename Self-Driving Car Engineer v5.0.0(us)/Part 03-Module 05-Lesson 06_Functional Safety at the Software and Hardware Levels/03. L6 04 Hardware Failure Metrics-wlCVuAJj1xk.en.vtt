00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.835
Random hardware failures will happen. There's no way around it.

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:09.115
For example, silicon can wear out or connections can break due to thermal expansion.

00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:14.220
Cosmic radiation and magnetic fields also cause hardware to fail as well.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.490
The number of failures permitted within a given period of time,

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:18.959
will depend on the ASIL.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.780
For example, an ASIL D element should have

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.335
fewer than one failure every 100 million hours.

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.570
Besides these hardware failure target values,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.429
the function safety standard defines

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.255
a few random hardware metrics called architectural Safety Metrics.

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.390
These metrics are: the single point fault metric,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.759
the latent fault metric and the probabilistic metric for random hardware failures.

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:47.670
Each ASIL has different allowable thresholds for these three metrics.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.250
We won't go into the details of how to calculate them.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.530
You can find more information in section five of the Functional Safety Standard.
