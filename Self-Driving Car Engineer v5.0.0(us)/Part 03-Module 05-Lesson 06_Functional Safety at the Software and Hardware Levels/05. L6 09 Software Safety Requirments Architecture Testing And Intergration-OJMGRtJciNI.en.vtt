00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
From the standpoint of functional safety,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.800
software development involves four main tasks.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.480
The first task is developing software safety requirements.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.400
The second task is to specify a software architecture.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.109
Then, the third task is to test

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.550
the software to make sure that the architecture meets the requirements.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.370
Lastly, software is integrated with hardware.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.220
These four tasks might look familiar.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:31.604
They are the same four steps we've discussed previously for all levels of the V-diagram.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:34.064
Where do software safety requirements come from?

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:36.119
Many software safety requirements are

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.494
derived directly from the technical safety requirements.

00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:42.479
In general, these requirements cover functions that

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.492
enables the system to maintain or reach a safe state.

00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:48.210
Functions for detecting, indicating,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.799
and handling faults in both hardware and software.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.390
Typical software safety requirements might be based on

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.730
timing constraints such as fault tolerant time intervals.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.964
Warning light functionality is also often associated with software safety requirements.

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:06.534
Communication interfaces like CAN, Ethernet connections,

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:11.750
or user interfaces are also commonly solved with software safety requirements.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.560
In the text below we will derive

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.450
a few software safety requirements from

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.265
the lane departure warning technical safety requirements.

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:22.135
And then we'll allocate at these requirements to the architecture.

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:26.760
Keep in mind that there is no such thing as a separate safety software architecture.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.710
The safety software requirements are

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.649
allocated to the overall product architectural design.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.900
Besides technical safety requirements,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.460
there are a few other sources of

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.569
software safety requirements that we will talk about in the next part of the.
