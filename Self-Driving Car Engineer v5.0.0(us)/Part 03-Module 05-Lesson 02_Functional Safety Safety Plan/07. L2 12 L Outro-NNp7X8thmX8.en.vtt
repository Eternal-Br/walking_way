00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
We have gone through the major parts of a safety plan.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.130
The safety plan would be one of the first steps in developing a safe product.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.580
Designing a system under

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.830
the functional safety standard requires methodical planning and execution.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.160
The safety plan serves as a guide to what will be done to achieve functional safety.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.320
The plan also defines responsibilities between the players involved in the project.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.179
This ensures that everybody knows what to do and that somebody is covering every task.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.420
As the project passes through the design, implementation,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.155
and production phases, the output will be checked against the safety plan.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.975
Now that you have seen the major parts of a safety plan,

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:39.990
we will move onto the concept phase of the V-model.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.000
We will start out with how to perform a hazard analysis and risk assessment.
