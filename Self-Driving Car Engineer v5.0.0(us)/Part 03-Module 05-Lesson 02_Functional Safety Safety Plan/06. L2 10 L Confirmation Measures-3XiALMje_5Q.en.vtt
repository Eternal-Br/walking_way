00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
The last part of the safety plan that we will

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.099
discuss is the Confirmation Measures section.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.949
Confirmation measures check three things:

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.400
that our processes comply with the functional safety standard,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.804
that their project execution is following the safety plan,

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:17.850
and that the design really does improve safety.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.910
These measures are carried out by independent people who are not

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.565
involved in the design or implementation of the product.

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:29.515
The safety plan should describe what specific confirmation measures will be used.

00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:31.949
The plan will also discuss who is responsible for

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.795
each measure in addition to how these measures will be carried out.

00:00:35.795 --> 00:00:39.030
Confirmation measures help ensure that the people who design

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.000
the product and the people who review the design are independent.
