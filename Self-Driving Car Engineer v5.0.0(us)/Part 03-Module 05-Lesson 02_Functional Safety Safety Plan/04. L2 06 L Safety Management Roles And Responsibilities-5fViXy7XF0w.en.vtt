00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
Another part of the safety plan,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.754
involves defining roles and responsibilities.

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:10.568
One person would not be expected to do all of the work required by ISO 26262.

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:15.075
In fact, developing the functional safety of a product can involve multiple teams,

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:18.259
both within a company and across different companies.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.380
Some of the most important roles in a safety related project include,

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:24.660
the project manager who ensures all of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.875
the necessary resources are available to the project.

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.899
The safety manager, who would write the safety plan and

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.359
then monitor the project progress against that plan.

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.719
A safety engineer, would be responsible for

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.670
architectural designs and implementation steps like integration and testing.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.520
The safety auditor, makes sure that the company

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.265
implements processes according to the functional safety standard.

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:49.799
The safety assessor, acts as

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.009
an independent judge as to whether the project has made the vehicle safer.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:59.000
A test manager, plans the tests that determine whether the system works as expected.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.215
Clearly defined roles in the safety plan,

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:04.250
ensure that each member of the team knows what to do.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.730
Defining roles, also ensures that every activity has a team member assigned to it.
