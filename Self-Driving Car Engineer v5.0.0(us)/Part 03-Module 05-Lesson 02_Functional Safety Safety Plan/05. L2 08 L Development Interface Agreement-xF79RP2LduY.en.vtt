00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.325
The automotive supply chain is generally divided into three players: OEMs,

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:08.294
Tier 1 suppliers, and Tier 2 suppliers.

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:12.115
OEM stands for, Original Equipment Manufacturer.

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:16.283
These are the brand name automotive companies that sell cars to consumers,

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:20.804
but OEMs do not necessarily develop all of their vehicle systems in-house.

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:25.140
OEMs outsource some development to what are called Tier 1 suppliers.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.135
The OEM and Tier 1 supplier,

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:30.280
then take on a customer supplier relationship.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.829
The OEM might provide requirements for what a vehicle system needs to do and then,

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.259
the Tier 1 supplier develops and produces the system for the OEM.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:43.229
Or, the OEM might provide a preliminary product design and then,

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:46.049
the Tier 1 will finish the details.

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.864
Tier 1 companies, oftentimes outsource their own work to Tier 2 companies.

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:52.380
A common example would be,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.775
a Tier 1 that sources an electronic control unit from a Tier 2 company.

00:00:56.774 --> 00:00:58.859
Then, the Tier 1 supplier uses

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.479
the electronic control unit to develop an automatic braking system for the OEM.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.977
In the safety plan,

00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:09.409
there is a section called the Development Interface Agreement, or the DIA.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.819
The DIA, delineates the design and

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.899
production responsibilities between the OEM and the Tier 1 supplier,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.960
or the Tier 1 supplier and the Tier 2 supplier.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.319
Why include the Development Interface Agreement in the safety plan?

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.519
One reason is to avoid disputes during the planning and development of a product.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.519
Another reason is liability.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:32.084
If a vehicle has a safety issue after being sold to consumers,

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:34.919
a Development Interface Agreement provides clarity about

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.079
which company is best positioned to fix the system.
