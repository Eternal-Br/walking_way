00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.855
Before analyzing a system under ISO 26262,

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:05.280
you need to create a plan.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.620
Designing a safe vehicle requires more than

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.070
a methodical analysis of hardware and software components.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.650
Vehicles are complex systems with both sociological and technical requirements.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.815
If your company or team does not take safety seriously,

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:20.940
how can you expect to design a safe vehicle?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.425
If roles and responsibilities haven't been defined,

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:25.830
important design steps might be missed.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.939
So our first step in functional safety is to write a safety plan.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.785
The safety plan forces us to define roles

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.979
then outline the steps we will take to achieve functional safety.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:36.839
In this lesson we will teach you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.020
the basic parts of a safety plan so that you can document your own.
