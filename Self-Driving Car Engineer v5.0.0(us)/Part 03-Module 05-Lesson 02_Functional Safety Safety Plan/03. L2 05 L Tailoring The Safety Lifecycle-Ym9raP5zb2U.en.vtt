00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.765
Let's look again at the steps contained in the V-model.

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:06.875
The V-model shows the entire safety life cycle,

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:09.089
starting from the concept phase through

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.054
their product development and ending in production.

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:14.849
In general, a functional safety manager will

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.179
need to coordinate and document the entire cycle.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.250
Ask yourself, is my product new or am I modifying an existing product?

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.245
If you are designing a new product,

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.150
you'll have to follow and document the entire safety lifecycle.

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.994
If you are modifying a product that already exist,

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:35.950
you might not have to implement all of the steps in the safety lifecycle.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.429
New functionality perhaps only impacts

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.104
certain parts of the concept phase or product development phase,

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:44.789
so you can tailor the safety lifecycle to include

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.210
only the parts impacted by the new functionality.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.579
That way, you can reuse some of the work that has already been done.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.924
Let's say, for example,

00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:59.140
that you are working on updating an automatic braking system that already exists.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.005
Your company has decided to use

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:05.609
a new electronic control unit with a faster, more powerful processor.

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:09.209
However, the break system's functionality has not changed.

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:14.484
Your first step is to make sure the new ECU really would not affect the braking system.

00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:16.859
If the new ECU has no effect,

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.709
you might not have to change anything in the design.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.819
You could also reuse part of the original functional safety analysis.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.239
However, you would still need to run tests to make sure

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:31.114
the new electronic control unit integrates with the rest of the system.

00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:32.643
In the safety plan,

00:01:32.644 --> 00:01:38.460
you would need to discuss if the product being developed is new or just a modification.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.529
Then you tailor the safety lifecycle and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.680
discuss what sections of the V-model need to be included.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.960
Tailoring the safety lifecycle allows you

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.329
to focus on the parts of the product that are new.
