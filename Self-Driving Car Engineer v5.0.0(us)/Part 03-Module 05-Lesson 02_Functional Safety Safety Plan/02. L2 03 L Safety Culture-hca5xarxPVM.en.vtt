00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
It's important to understand that

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.504
technology malfunctions are not the only source of vehicle accidents.

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:09.164
Social and organizational factors play a role as well.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:14.669
An organization should develop clear policies and strategies to support the development,

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.030
production, and operation of safe systems.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.955
Imagine what would happen if your manager told you to skip

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:24.704
a few software integration tests in order to meet a deadline?

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:27.299
Would you feel comfortable telling your manager no?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.359
Does your company have clear policies about what to do if you

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.019
encounter design problems that aren't your responsibility?

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.445
Decisions about technology after all, are made by humans.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:40.480
And humans are fallible.

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:45.029
Good safety culture, put safety as the highest priority over competing constraints,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.370
like cost and productivity.

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:49.919
Design decisions need to be well documented and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.579
traceable back to the people who made those decisions.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.439
Companies should reward achieving safe systems and penalize taking shortcuts.

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:00.724
Without a good safety culture,

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:03.329
functional safety is difficult to achieve.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.459
Your safety plan will need to include

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.269
information about how your company promotes a safe culture.
