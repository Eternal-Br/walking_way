00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
So let's learn about classification. Here's the plan.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.919
I'm going to tell you just enough so that you can put together

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.179
a very simple but very important type of classifier called a logistic classifier.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.154
With that, you'll be able to run through the first assignment,

00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:19.054
which will have you download and preprocess some images for classification,

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:21.920
and then run an actual logistic classifier on that data.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.525
Once you've connected the bit of math

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.554
that's coming up and the code in that first assignment,

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:30.789
everything else will just be building up from there.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.000
We will be building together all of deep learning on top of this piece, block by block.
