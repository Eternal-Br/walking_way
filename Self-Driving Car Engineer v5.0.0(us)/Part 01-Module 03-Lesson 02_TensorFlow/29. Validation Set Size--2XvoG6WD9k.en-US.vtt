00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.680
Let's do some back of
the envelope calculations.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.459
Imagine you have 3,000 examples
in your variation set, and

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.008
assume you trust my
hand wavey rule of 30.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:14.006
Which level of accuracy improvement
can you trust to not be in the notice?

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:19.326
A difference from 80% to 81%,
a difference from 80%

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:24.151
to 80.5%, a difference of 80% to 80.1%?
