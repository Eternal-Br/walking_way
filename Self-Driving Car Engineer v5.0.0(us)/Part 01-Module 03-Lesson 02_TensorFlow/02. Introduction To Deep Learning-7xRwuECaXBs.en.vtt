00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
&gt;&gt; Once again, we're in the fortunate position to be

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.835
able to bring a world expert into the classroom.

00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:07.320
Vincent Vanhoucke is the principal scientist of

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.449
Google's deep learning team and he'll teach you the fundamentals of deep neural networks.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.469
&gt;&gt; Vincent will cover the jump from machine learning to deep learning,

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.379
the architecture of multi-layer deep neural networks

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.085
and the concepts underpinning convolutional neural networks.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:26.370
A convolutional neural network is a specialized type of

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.565
deep neural network that turns out to be particularly important for self-driving cars.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:32.969
At the end of this section,

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.534
you'll use the TensorFlow deep learning library

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:37.979
to build your own convolutional neural network.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:39.419
&gt;&gt; Within the course, you'll see

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.273
optional assignments which are designed to familiarize you with TensorFlow.

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:47.845
These assignments are a great way to get more practice and stand out to employers.

00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:51.869
&gt;&gt; First things first. Let's learn from Vincent about how to take what you know about

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:53.460
machine learning and use it as

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.000
an entry point to deep learning. We'll see you when you finish.
