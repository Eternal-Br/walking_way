00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.425
Imagine that your validation set has just six examples with an accuracy of 66 percent.

00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:12.720
Now you tweak your model and your performance goes from 66 percent to 83 percent.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.450
Is this something you can trust? No, of course.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.045
This is only a change of label for a single example.

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:20.875
It could just be noise.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.305
The bigger your test set,

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.490
the less noisy the accuracy measurement will be.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.985
Here is a useful rule of thumb.

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:29.295
And if you're a statistician,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.730
feel free to cover your ears right now.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.875
A change that affects 30 examples in your validation sets one way or another,

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:41.000
is usually statistically significant and typically can be trusted.
