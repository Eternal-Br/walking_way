00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
One of the coolest things that happened in last decade is that

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:07.265
Google released a framework for deep learning called TensorFlow.

00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:09.980
TensorFlow makes all that hard work that you've

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.880
done superfluous because now you have a software framework.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.605
They can very easily configure and train

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.120
deep networks and TensorFlow can be run on many machines at the same time.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.230
So, we're going to teach you some about TensorFlow

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.785
because if you become a machine learning expert,

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.719
these are the tools that people in the trade use everyday.
