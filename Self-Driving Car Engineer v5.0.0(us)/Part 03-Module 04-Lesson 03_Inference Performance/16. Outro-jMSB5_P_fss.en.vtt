Congratulations. We have cover a lot in this lesson.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.439
You learned how to accelerate inference with fusion,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.259
reduced precision, quantization and freezing the network.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.570
Additionally, you apply this optimization to a fully convolutional network graph.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.480
Next up, is the semantic segmentation project

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.289
where you take what you learned and put it into practice.
