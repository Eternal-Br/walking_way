00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.825
You may have noticed semantic segmentation is computationally intensive.

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:09.600
It's not uncommon for this pipeline to put out four to seven frame per second,

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.289
while bounding boxes such as YOLO run at 4,290 FPS.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.489
Semantic segmentation has advantages over bounding boxes obviously.

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:19.934
But in its current state,

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:23.299
the segmentation system is simply not fast enough.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.455
However, with various optimizations,

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:29.894
we can increase the performance of this system by three to five times.

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:35.000
We will cover fusion quantization and graph to binary optimizations next.
