00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.024
The first question you might have is, "Why even bother?

00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:05.314
Are neural networks fast enough already?"

00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:09.140
And that's a good question. The answer depends on the application.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.060
If we were classifying whether something is a hotdog or not a hotdog,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.320
we'd be fine with out of the box inference speeds.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.734
Autonomous vehicles however, are more demanding than just identifying hotdogs.

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.975
The perception system in our vehicle has to make predictions in real time.

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:28.580
We can't use cloud computing resources due to the latency.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:34.079
So all of these predictions must take place on the vehicle computational hardware.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.070
Squeezing every last bit of performance out of this hardware is crucial.
