00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
Welcome to Inference Optimizations.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.200
In this lesson, you'll learn how to take your model the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.890
last mile and accelerate how quickly it performs inference,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.165
or how fast it can make predictions.

00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:15.604
You will learn various optimizations such as fusion,

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:18.769
quantization and machine code compilation.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.910
Then we will walk through how to take advantage of these techniques intensive flow.
