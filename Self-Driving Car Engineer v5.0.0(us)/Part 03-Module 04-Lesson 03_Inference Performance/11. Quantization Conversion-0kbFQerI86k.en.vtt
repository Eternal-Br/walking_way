00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
There are a variety of ways to convert our floating point values to integers.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.615
The simplest is a linear conversion.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:08.460
A convenient characteristics of

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.725
neural network weights is they inhibit a relatively small range.

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:14.955
For example, in that layer,

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:17.535
weights might range from -8 to 10.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:20.699
To perform a linear conversion we would assign -8 to 0,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.259
1 to 128 and 10 to 255,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.855
and all the values in between accordingly.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:32.759
Notice it's easy to convert back to a floating point number if need be as well.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.923
With just this small change,

00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:37.259
we save 75% in this pace.
