00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.850
The matrix, W, here, takes, as an input,
the entire image, so 28x28 pixels.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.358
The output is of size 10, so
the other dimension of the matrix is 10.

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:15.090
The biases are just 1x10.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.750
So the total number of
parameters are 28x28x10,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.724
plus another ten, that gives you 7,850.
