00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.310
The simple model that you've trained so
far is nice, but

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.450
it's also relatively limited.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.080
Here is a question for you.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.940
How many train parameters
did it actually have?

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.680
As a reminder, each input was a 28 by 28
image, and the output was 10 classes.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.040
Enter the number of parameters here.
