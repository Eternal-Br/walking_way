00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.035
Because we're lazy engineers,

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.825
we're going to take something that works-

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:08.065
our logistic classifier and do the minimal amount of change to make it nonlinear.

00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:12.832
We're going to construct our new function in the simplest way that we can think of.

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:16.680
Instead of having a single matrix multiply as our classifier,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.845
we're going to insert a ReLU right in the middle.

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:21.555
We now have two matrices,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.420
one going from the inputs to the ReLUs

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.815
and another one connecting the ReLUs to the classifier.

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:29.700
We've solved two of our problems.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.350
Our function is now nonlinear,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.045
thanks to the ReLU in the middle,

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:36.795
and we now have a new knob that we can tune this number H

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:41.040
which corresponds to the number of ReLU units that we have in the classifier.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.900
We can make it as big as we want.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.480
Congratulations you've built your first neural network.
