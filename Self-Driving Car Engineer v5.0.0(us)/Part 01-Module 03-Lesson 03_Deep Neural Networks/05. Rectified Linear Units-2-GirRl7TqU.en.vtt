00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.550
Let me introduce you to the lazy
engineer's favorite non-linear function:

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.060
the rectified linear units,
or RELU for short.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.440
RELUs are literally the simplest
non-linear functions you can think of.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.960
They're linear if x is greater than 0,
and they're the 0 everywhere else.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.830
RELUs have nice derivatives, as well.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.390
Which of these plots do you think best
represents the derivative of a RELU?
