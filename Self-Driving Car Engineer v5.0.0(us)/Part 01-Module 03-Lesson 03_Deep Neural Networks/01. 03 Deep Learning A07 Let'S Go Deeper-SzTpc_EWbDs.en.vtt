00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.294
Let's take our neural networks one level

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:05.355
deeper and learn about concepts that every expert knows.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:09.075
Things like activation function, normalization, regularization,

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:11.719
and even things like dropouts to make the training more robust

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.200
so you can become much more proficient in training neural networks.
