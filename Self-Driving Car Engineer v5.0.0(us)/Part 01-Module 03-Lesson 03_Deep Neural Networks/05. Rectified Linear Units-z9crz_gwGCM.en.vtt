00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.680
When x is less than zero,
the value is 0.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.790
So, the derivative is 0 as well.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.720
When x is greater than 0,
the value is equal to x.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.500
So, the derivative is equal to 1.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.360
The second answer is the right answer.
