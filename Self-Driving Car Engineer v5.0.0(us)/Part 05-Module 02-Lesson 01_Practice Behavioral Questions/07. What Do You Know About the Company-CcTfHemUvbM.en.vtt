Hi everybody.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.020
I'll be answering the question,
what do you know about our company?.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.390
So before the interview
I did a bit of research.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.210
I read articles,
I checked out some blog posts.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.630
I went on the Udacity website and
read the about us section and

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.120
then checked out a few
courses in nanodegrees.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.730
And what I learned is
that Udacity is trying to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.740
change the way that people learn.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.090
Before, it was thought that education
is something that happens at the first

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.730
four years of adulthood,
and stops right there.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.090
The rest of your career you
don't need to worry about it.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.200
But, of course, the world is changing
much, much, much too rapidly for

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.790
that to still be the case.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.064
Today people have to learn
throughout their careers.

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:38.310
So what Udacity is doing is
trying to change education and

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.109
turn it into something that people
can do throughout their lives.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.497
It's an education that can happen when
people want it and how people want it.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:48.685
And it also is there to
help people get new jobs.

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:52.850
Udacity also has the opportunity
to teach people a new way simply

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.300
because this education
is happening online.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.770
People have computers in front of them
which means that you can go much beyond

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.320
simply offering videos and quizzes,
and you can create totally

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.550
new educational experiences that not
just connect people with material,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.140
but also connect people with each other.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.320
So I think that Udascity is
a company that's doing their best

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.740
to change the way that people learn and
I think they're doing it for the better.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.240
Thanks.
