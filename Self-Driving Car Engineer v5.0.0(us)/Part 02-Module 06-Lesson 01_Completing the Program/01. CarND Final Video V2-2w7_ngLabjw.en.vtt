00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.764
Congratulations.

00:00:01.764 --> 00:00:07.540
You've successfully completed the Udacity Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.365
Hey, David.

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:11.810
Rahim Kenan, I haven't seen you since sensor fusion.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.100
Yeah, it's good to see you again.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.990
Realize if you stopped coming to work,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.455
they stop paying you.

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:19.254
No, It's cool. I've been working on other robots.

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:22.254
But this is the end of the car ND program,

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.169
just too exciting to miss.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.720
I mean, just think about it,

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:27.960
you've honed your skills in computer vision,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.280
deep learning, sensor fusion,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.420
localization, path planning, and more. That's awesome.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.660
You've constructed controllers with Uber ATG or

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.294
localized a vehicle fused radar and lidar data,

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:46.359
and built a path planner with a fantastic team of engineers from Mercedes-Benz.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:52.054
You deployed your code to a real self-driving car, that is fantastic.

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:54.020
They're supposed to be confetti.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.730
Did they cut the confetti budget?

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.684
The confetti budget? I don't know.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:00.350
Hey, Sebastian.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.645
Ryan, David.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:03.825
Hey, you're ready to go?

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:06.165
Not yet because there's students here.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.734
Students, this is a really,

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.659
really sad moment for me in class because we come to the end.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.539
I want to say a few words about Dave and Ryan and the team.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.165
These guys have built the Nanodegree Program.

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.625
Not just the two of them, but all the people that you can see lined up right now,

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:22.790
and it's been amazing,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.170
I've gotten tons of positive comments.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.415
It's become the largest self-driving car education program in the world.

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:34.710
In fact, you teach most students in all universities combined.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.879
Now, to you students,

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:38.679
I'm sad to say goodbye,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.865
but you come to the end of the program and you have done an astounding job.

00:01:42.864 --> 00:01:44.114
I've looked at the projects,

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:48.284
I've helped design them and base of what you documented and those are your skills,

00:01:48.284 --> 00:01:52.140
I'd have easily hired you into any self-driving car team ever run.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.305
I've ran a few.

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:56.480
I really want you to celebrate,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.500
to be happy that you get this Nanodegree.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.724
It's a major accomplishment in your life.

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:03.289
I want to be able to tell you go out and

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.135
change the world and make the world a better place.

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:08.469
All right. Enough already, let's get out of here.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:12.090
Really? Bye-bye.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.220
All right. I'll drive.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.289
No, I'm driving.

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:18.789
Come on David, I'd like to drive.

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.759
I haven't been here in five months.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.269
I haven't seen you. I don't even know who you are anymore.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.920
Come on, I've been working on other robots.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.724
It's just sort of the same thing, we're collaborators, right?

00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:26.960
No.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.240
Wait.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.975
Come back.

00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:33.430
The car took Sebastian.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.239
There's the confetti.
