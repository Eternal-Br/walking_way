00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
Welcome back. In the next few concepts,

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:05.990
we will walk through critical steps for localizing

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.540
our car by implementing a particle filter.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.540
Our ultimate goal is determine how well each of

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.725
our particle positions represents the actual position of our car.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:22.395
To do this, we must use car sensor and map inputs to weigh each particle.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:24.250
In the next few concepts,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.825
we will walk through this process for a single particle by

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:32.805
transforming car sensor landmark observations from the car coordinate system,

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:34.710
to the map coordinate system,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.260
associating these transformed observations with the nearest landmark on the map.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.630
Updating our particle weight by applying

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.220
the multivariate Gaussian probability density function for each measurement,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.065
then combining the probabilities of all the measurements by taking their product.

00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:55.300
This final weight is our posterior probability.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.245
In this video, we will go over the first step,

00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:01.795
transforming observations to map coordinates.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:06.615
This figure here depicts a car observing three nearby landmarks,

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:11.455
L5, L1, and L2.

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:14.280
The car sees them as observation one,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.535
observation two, and observation three.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.245
Remember that by convention,

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.870
we define the car's coordinates such as X is

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.870
pointed in the direction of the vehicle's heading with

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.165
y rotated plus 90 degrees or to the left perpendicular as depicted here.

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:36.775
The blue box in this figure represents a particle whose weight we want to update.

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:41.850
To do this, we will transform the car observations to map coordinates.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.080
We can achieve this transformation by passing our data through

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.740
a trigonometric function that maps car coordinates, to map coordinates.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.665
This function is called a homogeneous transformation,

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:56.280
and is composed of a rotation in a translation.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.255
Essentially, we all need to rotate the maps frame to match the particles point of view.

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:06.195
Then we will move the origin of the frame to the location of the particle.

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:09.765
We can do both of these steps in one matrix multiplication,

00:02:09.765 --> 00:02:12.650
using the homogeneous transformation.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.550
We know that our particle has a heading of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.420
negative 90 degrees and a map location of four come of five.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.090
We can visualize this process by drawing a coordinate frame at the map origin,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.840
then determining the location of the particle frame in the map coordinate system.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.400
To get to the particles frame from the mass point of view,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.940
we first have to rotate by negative 90 degrees like so,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.010
then we'll move to the particles position by

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.795
passing our observation coordinates XC and YC,

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:50.485
our particle coordinates XP and YP and a rotation angle theta of negative 90 degrees.

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:56.070
This homogeneous transformation right here does exactly what we just did.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.740
This formulation with the extra one as a third row is known as homogeneous coordinates.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.830
More detail can be found in the instructor notes.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.570
Let's quickly break down this homogeneous transformation here.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.580
The two by two matrix in the top left represents the rotation component about the Z axis.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.150
Remember that we're only doing this in 2D right now.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.975
The third column here represents the translation component.

00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:24.300
We complete the transformation by multiplying

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.180
through by the observation in car coordinates.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.245
To summarize, this homogeneous transformation is a transformation

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:35.715
from car coordinates to map coordinates in the maps frame.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.770
Using our observations in the car

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.240
coordinate system and our particle pose in the map system,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.710
we have everything we need to transform observations into map coordinates,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.970
and ultimately determine the final weight of our particle. Good luck.
