00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.240
In this lesson, we will
go over some implementation

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.630
details to get you ready to
make your own particle filter.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.039
We will start with the
pseudocode shown here,

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.729
which outlines the steps you
will need to take in your code.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.400
This first line here is
the initialization step

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.630
for the filter.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.210
Next, this line here
is the prediction step

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.969
of the filter, which is
analogous to the prediction

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.579
step of the base
filter you saw before.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.969
Here, you will add the control
input to all of the particles.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.070
This next part is
the update step,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.339
where you will update
each particle's weight.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.530
The second for loop is the
all-important resampling step

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.990
that you learned about
in the previous lesson.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.870
Once the resampling is done,
the new set of particles

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:42.179
represents the Bayes
filter posterior.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.899
Here is a flowchart representing
the particle filter algorithm

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.969
you just saw as pseudocode.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.339
Next, we'll take a closer
look at the first step

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.150
of the chart--

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.310
initialization-- so
that you'll know how

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.910
to initialize your particles.
