00:00:00.274 --> 00:00:02.439
Once you finish
implementing your particle

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:06.429
filter, I will ask you to assess
how accurate your position

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:08.349
estimates were.

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.830
For your project, I have given
you the ground truth position

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.550
of the car for every time step.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.140
Your results might
look something

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.980
like this, where the red
car is the ground truth

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.440
and the blue car is the result
of your particle filter.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.780
We will now discuss
two different ways

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.020
to quantify the difference
between your results

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.780
and the ground truth.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.179
One way you could
report your error

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.429
is to take the weighted average
error of all the particles.

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.189
To do this, simply
take the root squared

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:48.119
error between each
particle and ground truth,

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.179
and multiply it by
the particle's weight.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.759
Remember that in this
equation, Pi and g

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:00.359
are vectors that contain
the x position, y

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.489
position, and [INAUDIBLE] of
the car in map coordinates.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.290
Then, you'll have to divide
by the sum of the weights.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.359
Another possibility
is to just look

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:16.349
at the best, or the
highest-weighted particle,

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:20.759
and simply take the root
squared error of this particle.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.160
Now, I want you to
practice reporting

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.099
the error of the particle
filter for a particular time

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:31.250
step given the best particle
and the ground truth position.
