00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:01.889
The next
part of the filter

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.740
you will need to implement
is the prediction step.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.080
For the prediction
step, you will

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.720
use what you learned in
the motion models lesson

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.800
to predict where the car will
be at the next time step.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.679
For each particle, you will
have to update the particle's

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.719
location based on velocity
and [INAUDIBLE] measurements.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.960
To account for the uncertainty
in the control input,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.170
in the project you will
also add Gaussian noise

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.800
to the velocity and [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.140
Now, I want you to
practice calculating

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.539
the prediction of
a car's position,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.869
assuming a basic motion
model and disregarding

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:42.859
sensor uncertainty for now.
