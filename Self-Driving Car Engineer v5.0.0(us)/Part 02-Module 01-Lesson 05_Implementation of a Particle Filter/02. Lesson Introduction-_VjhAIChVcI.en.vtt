00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
Hi again, everyone.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.939
I'm sitting in [? Sunny, ?]
our S500 intelligent car.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:06.849
Now that you know what
a particle filter is

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:09.039
and how it works, in
this lesson you'll

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.589
learn some important
implementation details.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.109
Afterwards, you'll be able
to complete a project which

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.480
involves making a particle
filter to localize

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.050
a self-driving car like
this one I'm sitting in now.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.184
Code can be a bit different
from theory and math,

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:24.100
so I'll go over a few
things you need to know,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.540
such as how to
assign measurements

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.149
to particular landmarks
in a given map.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.919
Additionally, I'll go
over the code frame

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.590
you'll be using so
you know how it works.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.230
Implementing algorithms has
always been my favorite part,

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.599
so I hope you'll enjoy
putting the theory and math

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.390
into a real working system too.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.000
Now we'll start by going over
the pseudocode for the particle

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.250
filter algorithm so you'll
know what steps you'll

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.289
have to execute to successfully
implement a particle filter.
