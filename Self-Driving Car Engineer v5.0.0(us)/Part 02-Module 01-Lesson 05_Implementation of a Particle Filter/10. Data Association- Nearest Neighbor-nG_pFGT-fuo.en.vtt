00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.609
Before we can use landmark
measurements of the objects

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.359
around us to update the
belief of our position,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.150
we'll have to solve the
data association problem.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.699
Data association is
the problem of matching

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.239
landmark measurements to
objects in the real world,

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.439
like map landmarks.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.800
Let's look at an example to
show why data association is

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.570
so important.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.879
We can assume that
we're confident that we

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:31.780
have two lidar sensor
measurements, here and here.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.880
Which of these two measurements
corresponds to this rock?

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.265
If we pick the top
measurement, then we

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:41.280
will estimate that the
true position of the car

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.020
is actually here.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.520
Remember that for localization,
when sensor measurements--

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.560
or what we actually see--

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.600
matches to map landmarks--

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.670
what we expect to see--

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.039
this must be the true
position of the car.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.969
However, if we pick
the bottom measurement,

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.240
then we will estimate that
the true position of the car

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.650
is here.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.620
So how do we pick the
right measurement?

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.750
For the self-driving
car, you might

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.069
have a map with landmarks,
shown in blue, and lidar

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.469
measurements, shown in orange.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.439
Oftentimes, you have
some map landmarks

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.689
that have multiple
lidar measurements that

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.759
could correspond to it.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.770
To pick the right
correspondents,

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:29.379
we can use a very
simple technique called

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:30.909
nearest neighbor.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.390
In this method, simply take
the closest measurement

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.260
as the correct correspondents,
like the circled map landmark

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.030
and lidar measurement.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.019
Here, the red circles
represent the associations

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:47.259
between the map landmarks
and lidar measurements

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.329
that we would pick
using nearest neighbor.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.890
Now, I want you to use your
understanding of the nearest

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.219
neighbor technique to
answer a conceptual question

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.900
about its strengths
and weaknesses.
