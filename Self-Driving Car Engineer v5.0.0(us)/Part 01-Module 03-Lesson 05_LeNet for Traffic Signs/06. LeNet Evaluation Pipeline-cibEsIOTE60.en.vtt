00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
In this code cell,

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.838
we set up another pipeline,

00:00:02.838 --> 00:00:04.740
this time for evaluating the model.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.199
The training pipeline we just set up is what trains the model,

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:13.154
but the evaluation pipeline we create here will evaluate how good the model is.

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:16.439
The first step in this pipeline is to measure whether a given prediction is

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.700
correct by comparing the logit prediction to the one-hot encoded ground truth label.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.210
The second step in the pipeline is to calculate

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.460
the model's overall accuracy by averaging the individual prediction accuracies.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.024
These two lines are the entire evaluation pipeline.

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.789
But in order to run this evaluation pipeline,

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.460
we have to build an evaluate function.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.725
This function takes a dataset as input,

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.870
sets some initial variables,

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:47.174
and then batches the dataset and runs it through the evaluation pipeline.

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:50.039
The evaluate function averages the accuracy of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.269
each batch to calculate the total accuracy of the model.
