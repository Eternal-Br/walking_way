00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:09.120
Remember, we should only run the model on the test dataset one time,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.539
once we are completely done with training.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.079
Otherwise, we would be using the test dataset to choose the best model and

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.849
then the test dataset wouldn't provide

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.050
a good estimate of how well the model would do in the real world.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.755
So I'm not going to run this model on the test dataset right now.

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:27.149
You can do it when you're ready.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.729
That's the entire LeNet Lab end to end,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.310
and if you understand how this lab works,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.000
then you're ready to apply LeNet to the traffic sign classifier project.
