00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
&gt;&gt; Self-driving car engineers today use

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.205
two distinct approaches to autonomous development,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.949
a robotics approach, and a deep learning approach.

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.644
The robotics approach fuses output from a suite of sensors

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:16.844
to directly measure the vehicle surroundings and then navigate accordingly.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.109
Self-driving car engineers have been working on

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.589
and perfecting the robotics approach for many years.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.839
&gt;&gt; More recently, engineering teams have begun to use

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.335
deep learning as a different approach for developing autonomous vehicles.

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:31.920
Deep neural networks allow self-driving cars to learn how to drive,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.344
by mimicking human driving behavior.

00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:36.299
Both, the robotics and deep learning methods,

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:39.969
are actively being pursued today in the development of self-driving cars.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.554
&gt;&gt; So in this Nanodegree program,

00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:45.085
you'll be working with both approaches.

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:47.237
That way, you, as an engineer,

00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:49.304
will be prepared to work anywhere.

00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:53.700
By the end of this program you'll be teaming up with other students to actually write

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.550
both robotics and deep learning code to control a real self-driving car. Pretty Cool.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.649
&gt;&gt; Along the way you'll work through several modules,

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.625
with each one focusing on a different layer of the self-driving car technology stack,

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:06.915
and after each module,

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:09.195
you'll build a project to demonstrate what you've learned,

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:12.084
and you'll get real human feedback on your work.

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:13.589
This first module that you're going through now is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.469
smaller and should only take a week or so to complete.

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:20.280
Later modules will be longer and may take up to a month.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.174
&gt;&gt; In addition to receiving human feedback on your projects,

00:01:24.174 --> 00:01:26.610
you'll also have access to the forums where you

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.579
can ask questions and get to know your fellow students.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.039
And of course our team is here to help you succeed.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.300
So be sure to reach out and keep in touch.
