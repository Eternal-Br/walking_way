00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:03.886
The first time it's ever been done.

00:00:03.886 --> 00:00:06.009
&gt;&gt; Dawn breaks in Western Nevada.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.495
A crowd has gathered for
the race of the century.

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:12.524
[MUSIC]

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:14.650
In this race, there are no drivers.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.429
No human behind the wheel.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.620
These robots are on their own and their
humans observers can't even keep up.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.650
&gt;&gt; Literally outrunning us.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.544
&gt;&gt; I don't think I can do it
with this car, I can't keep up.

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:31.720
&gt;&gt; It's the first race ever where
the machine makes all the decisions.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:34.307
&gt;&gt; Think of it as
a technology demonstration.

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:38.359
It'll turn believers out
of the non-believers.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.799
&gt;&gt; Behind each robot is a team of
people who sacrificed everything

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:47.099
creating hardware and software to
attempt what's never been done before.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.310
&gt;&gt; You have to put the blood, sweat and

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.734
tears into your vehicle
to make it there.

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:58.319
&gt;&gt; I work 16 hour days,
seven days a week for months on end.

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:59.652
[MUSIC]

00:00:59.652 --> 00:01:02.480
&gt;&gt; The people that fell into
this project get consumed by it.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.340
I even dream about it.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.883
[MUSIC]

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:08.759
&gt;&gt; Dreams will now be put to the test.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.530
It's winner take all
with a $2 million prize.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.427
But the stakes are much higher.

00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:15.480
[MUSIC]

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.022
Can a machine navigate miles of
punishing desert terrain with

00:01:20.022 --> 00:01:23.000
the speed and agility of a human driver?

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:31.735
In October of 2005,

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:37.019
43 teams have brought their vehicles
to compete in a unique event.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.560
A race driven not by testosterone,
but computer code.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.140
These machines are robots, and they're
going to run an obstacle course with no

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.919
one behind the wheel and
no remote control.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.669
It's called the Grand Challenge,
and for good reason.

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:55.949
On a two mile course,

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.560
these robots are on their own and
there's plenty to trip them up.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.949
They'll encounter gates and
tunnels and all kinds of obstacles,

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.734
including parked cars and hay bales.

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:11.621
[MUSIC]

00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:14.260
The competition comes in all shapes and
sizes.

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.629
The smallest robot is Ghost Rider.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.500
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen,
the world's first autonomous motorcycle,

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.074
Ghost Rider, approaching obstacle one.

&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.031
&gt;&gt; Contact good, obstacle one.

00:03:34.073 --> 00:03:37.058
&gt;&gt; It'll right itself.

00:03:37.058 --> 00:03:41.811
&gt;&gt; As though raised from the dead,
Ghost Rider bravely forges on.

00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:45.171

a 16-ton truck called

TerraMax approaches the first gate and
hesitates.

[MUSIC]

00:03:58.612 --> 00:04:01.102
&gt;&gt; Come on baby crank it,
crank it, crank it.

00:04:01.102 --> 00:04:03.460
&gt;&gt; Do it, do it, do it, do it, nope.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.310
&gt;&gt; Like anxious parents,
its creators look on in agony,

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.469
but all they can do is watch as
TerraMax backs up and tries again.

[MUSIC]

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:18.235

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:23.151
&gt;&gt; What, no!

00:04:23.151 --> 00:04:27.832
&gt;&gt; On the eighth pass,
TerraMax squeezes through the gate and

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.620
heads for the finish.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.331
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, TerraMax.

00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:34.867
Perseverance.

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:40.240
&gt;&gt; Tommy has a lovable retro appearance
but looks are a bit deceiving.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.110
A computer glitch turns
the robot in to a wild beast.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.468
&gt;&gt; No!

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.970
&gt;&gt; Tommy has had contact
with the k barrier.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.336
&gt;&gt; There are no serious injuries,
but Tommy is out of the competition.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:58.074
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:58.074 --> 00:05:02.225
Team DAD has arrived from Silicon Valley
with a roof ornament that looks

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:04.030
like a relic from an old disco.

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.000
[MUSIC]

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.990
It's a homemade laser scanner, created
by Dave Hall and his brother Bruce.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.610
Even as they drive to the start,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.410
they're writing computer code
to make their scanner work.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.110
Now, it's showtime.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.045
&gt;&gt; We want to watch
the first one ready now.

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:25.689
Which one's up?

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.772
&gt;&gt; Almost immediately, they hit the hay.

00:05:33.773 --> 00:05:37.890
For this run, Team Dad,
like disco in the 70s, is dead.

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:41.429
But they'll have another chance.

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:46.649
Many universities are fielding teams.

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.933
And Stanley, Stanford's robot,

00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:53.512
looks like a high-tech version of
another VW, Herbie, the Love Bug.

Sebastian Thrun.

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:05.039
For him, the Grand Challenge
is a Woodstock for robo geeks.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.000
&gt;&gt; There's very little in
the way of competitiveness here.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.014
Although everybody understands in the
end of the day everyone wants to win.

00:06:10.014 --> 00:06:13.217
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Hello, Sir.

00:06:13.218 --> 00:06:13.653
It's been a big fest.

00:06:13.653 --> 00:06:15.829
There's like a thousand people
who care about the same thing,

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.199
making cars drive themselves,
and they all get together.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.053
It's a big festival, it's really great.

00:06:22.053 --> 00:06:26.779
[MUSIC]

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:27.053
&gt;&gt; So, you ready?

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:27.919
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.259
&gt;&gt; One, two, three.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.250
&gt;&gt; The largest team at the competition
is from Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.319
And for them,
the Grand Challenge is no lovefest.

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.096
&gt;&gt; But you were either thoroughly
rested, 200% effectiveness or

00:06:42.096 --> 00:06:43.781
you got some work to do.

00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:47.406
&gt;&gt; No one knows what it takes to
succeed in the Grand Challenge,

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:49.476
since no one anywhere has done it.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.896
The red team's prepared for anything.

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:57.425
&gt;&gt; And the trailer is [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Led by former Marine Red Whittaker,

00:06:57.425 --> 00:07:02.447
the red team is a well funded army
of computer wizards and engineers.

00:07:02.447 --> 00:07:04.876
The team has invested two years and

00:07:04.877 --> 00:07:09.081
millions of dollars to get
Sandstorm to the starting line.

00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:11.654
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen,
from Pittsburgh, PA.

00:07:11.654 --> 00:07:15.268
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; This is a nice angle for

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:18.966
the road approach, get crisp,
get crisp, get crisp.

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:22.204
Damn beautiful, beautiful.

00:07:22.204 --> 00:07:23.612
You can just see it there.

00:07:23.612 --> 00:07:28.668
&gt;&gt; Whoa, look at that,
that's the way, that's the way.

00:07:28.668 --> 00:07:30.289
Put the pedal to the metal.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.773
&gt;&gt; Sandstorm's aggressive
on the straightaway.

00:07:32.773 --> 00:07:36.070
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] hay bales.

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:39.870
&gt;&gt; But today, the robot has
a fatal attraction to hay bales.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.869
&gt;&gt; Contact with the hay bales.

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:45.360
[MUSIC]

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.737
&gt;&gt; Like all the entries, Sandstorm has
four chances to demonstrate agility and

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:52.318
speed for the judges.

00:07:52.317 --> 00:07:59.498
[MUSIC]

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:05.298
Based on their performance, 20 robots
will qualify for the main event.

00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:07.829
A long distance desert race and
a chance to win $2 million.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:16.701
The race is sponsored by DARPA, Defense
Advance Research Projects Agency.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.480
Their goal is to stimulate technology
that can be used by the military.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.620
&gt;&gt; If we can use unmanned vehicles in
dangerous missions like living supplies

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.959
into frontlines.

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:33.009
Then we can take drivers out of the
vehicles and they're less vulnerable.

00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:38.460
If you remember Private Jessica Lynch,
she was a driver of a supply vehicle and

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.710
if that was an autonomous vehicle,
that episode would have never happened.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.810
True autonomy, that's what we're after.

00:08:44.809 --> 00:08:46.858
It's a hard problem.

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:53.210
&gt;&gt; Just how hard a problem it is to
create a vehicle that can drive itself

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.550
became painfully clear a year earlier
at the first Grand Challenge race.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.184
Carnegie Mellon was one of 15
teams at the starting line.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.430
Racing against the clock, Sandstorm
was the first robot out of the game.

00:09:11.429 --> 00:09:16.639
To win, it had to run a course across
142 miles of ragged desert terrain

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.588
in less than ten hours.

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:24.430
But just seven miles from the start,

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:28.288
Sandstorm drifted off course and
got stuck on a rock.

00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:31.872
In a valiant effort to keep moving,

00:09:31.873 --> 00:09:38.140
the robot spun its wheels until
its tires burst into flame.

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:41.539
Back at the start, other robots
were having their own problems.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.615
&gt;&gt; Everything was set up for this high
speed rumble of all these vehicles.

00:09:49.615 --> 00:09:55.634
This careening through the dessert and
that's not how it happened.

00:09:55.634 --> 00:10:01.680
&gt;&gt; All 15 robots died of mechanical
failure, half in the first mile.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:05.589
In this group of losers,
Sandstorm went the farthest,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.280
leaving many to believe no robot
could ever win the grand challenge.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.630
&gt;&gt; The fact that the vehicle's
only traveled a short distance

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:15.259
show's that it was a tough
technical problem.

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:19.518
But where the success really lies in the
amount of people that actually responded

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:20.524
to the challenge.

00:10:20.524 --> 00:10:23.889
[MUSIC]

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:28.750
After this fiasco, Carnegie Mellon now
has a year to prepare for the next race.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's settle in, go to work.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.610
The five main things that we
said that we would get done for

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.370
today, I want it done.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.729
So it's not enough to wave hands and
say voila, this works.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.009
&gt;&gt; I signed up to succeed
in the Grand Challenge.

00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:53.879
This time around, the red team
will be more like a red army.

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:55.299
It is a machine to reckoned with.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.350
&gt;&gt; Red Whittaker's resume is
a veritable history of field robotics.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.379
His robots are battle-hardened machines
built to clean up Three Mile Island and

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:06.519
then Chernobyl.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:11.000
These rust belt brutes can map
dangerous mines, load trucks,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
remove asbestos and mow hay.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.441
They're global explorers that have
ventured across volcanoes, deserts and

00:11:18.441 --> 00:11:19.120
glaciers.

Now, Whittaker has staked his reputation
on winning the Grand Challenge.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.480
To double his chances, he's planning
to run two robots in the next race.

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:39.719
In addition to their veteran Sandstorm,
the red team will transform this new

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.240
Hummer into a more aggressive
machine called Highlander.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.700
For more than a year,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.319
Wait Gibbs has been documenting
Whittaker's Grand Challenge quest.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:55.979
&gt;&gt; Red Whittaker is nothing if
not an ambitious man [LAUGH].

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.159
&gt;&gt; He's a roboticist who in his weekends
goes out and drives a tractor for

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:02.009
ten hours on his farm.

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:06.129
And who likes to actually get in and
get his hands greasy and

00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:08.039
dirty inside an engine.

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:13.269
Red gets excited about seeing his robots
do powerful things in the real world

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:15.250
&gt;&gt; Think it's going to work.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.649
&gt;&gt; The thing, at this stage of the game,
it's making it work, right?

00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:20.039
Making it work.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:23.206
&gt;&gt; Take the hood off.

00:12:23.206 --> 00:12:31.232
[MUSIC]

00:12:31.232 --> 00:12:33.768
&gt;&gt; The red team will spend
several months replacing and

00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:35.620
modifying Highlander's hardware.

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:42.274
&gt;&gt; A tremendous amount
of these desert raising

00:12:42.274 --> 00:12:46.197
machines is heavy metal
iron [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:46.197 --> 00:12:50.190
It's heating and beating and
bashing and cutting and making.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:54.460
It's as important as
any of the software.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.059
It's a lot of fun.

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:01.139
To replace the human behind the wheel,
team members have

00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:05.370
installed an electromechanical system
to steer, shift, throttle and brake.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:11.239
They're installing sensors so
Highlander can see and GPS receivers so

00:13:11.239 --> 00:13:12.984
it can follow the race course.

00:13:12.984 --> 00:13:15.668
[MUSIC]

00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:18.144
And they're giving the robot a brain.

00:13:18.144 --> 00:13:22.530
Filling it with software,
so it can drive by itself.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.849
Now it might seem easy for
robots to drive.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.160
It happens all the time in movies.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.254
&gt;&gt; I'll drive.

00:13:33.254 --> 00:13:34.629
&gt;&gt; You think of the Terminator movies.

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:38.163
Science fiction gives a really distorted
view of capabilities of robots.

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:44.339
Those robots are able to
identify specific individuals.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.629
But in reality, robots have very
limited senses of perception.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.830
&gt;&gt; Robots know nothing
about their environment and

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.650
they can't think like humans.

00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:56.699
But they're really good
at crunching numbers.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.242
Most rely on laser range
finders to perceive the world.

00:14:00.241 --> 00:14:03.283
[MUSIC]

00:14:03.283 --> 00:14:06.748
Inside a beam of light bounces
off a spinning mirror and

00:14:06.748 --> 00:14:08.490
sweeps the terrain ahead.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.940
By measuring the time it takes
the beam to hit something and

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.780
return, the range finder can measure
its distance from the vehicle.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.200
Scanners are mounted in pairs
to measure different things.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.470
Some look for smooth road ahead, others
look for the road edge on each side.

00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:33.620
Some look for vertical objects, a rock
or a fence post that can kill a robot.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.410
Putting it all together, this becomes
Highlander's view of the world.

00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:44.934
&gt;&gt; A road map made from millions
of numbers that basically tells

00:14:44.934 --> 00:14:46.983
the robot bumpy or smooth.

00:14:46.984 --> 00:14:52.042
[MUSIC]

00:14:52.042 --> 00:14:56.776
Off on its own, Highlander will try to
avoid obstacles for the first time.

00:14:56.775 --> 00:15:06.775
[MUSIC]

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.150
Improving its driving skills will
take endless hours of programming.

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:22.840
&gt;&gt; The red team robots have on the order
of a million lines of computer code.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.840
Even so, they do very simple
reasoning about the world.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.700
They look for flat spots.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.180
Flat is good, drive on flat spots.

00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:32.899
Anything that's not flat, avoid it.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.271
&gt;&gt; But for the red team winning
the Grand Challenge involves much more

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.921
than writing computer code.

00:15:39.922 --> 00:15:45.173
[MUSIC]

00:15:45.173 --> 00:15:48.242
While some team members are testing
Highlander in the field,

00:15:48.243 --> 00:15:50.140
others are refurbishing Sandstorm.

00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:56.669
Another group is building
state of the art sensors and

00:15:56.669 --> 00:15:58.969
writing software never ends.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.119
&gt;&gt; What's left to do.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.629
&gt;&gt; Whittaker commands an army of 100 or
more with a $3 million war chest.

00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:09.669
He's determined to have two
robots at the starting line, and

00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:12.019
one in the winner's circle.

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.210
&gt;&gt; A lot of people work hard.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.000
Red team's no exception on that front.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.019
Winning a race isn't about working hard.

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:22.069
Yeah, you gotta do that,
but it's a lot more.

00:16:23.429 --> 00:16:26.739
If you haven't done everything,
you haven't done a thing.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.263
[MUSIC]

00:16:30.263 --> 00:16:34.374
Not all teams take Whittaker's all or
nothing approach.

00:16:34.374 --> 00:16:37.397
For the Hall brothers,
the grand challenge is great fun.

00:16:37.397 --> 00:16:39.360
[MUSIC]

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.980
Each day, Bruce and Dave program
their robot as they drive it to work.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.620
&gt;&gt; We have about a 45 minute drive each
day, and we're tired of driving it.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.700
We'd like to get into our vehicle and
hit the switch and

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.890
have it drive us home, frankly.

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:57.819
&gt;&gt; The Hall brothers own a company
that owns audio speakers.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.840
Bruce runs the daily business,
while Dave tinkers in the shop.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.740
&gt;&gt; Dave was the engineer and

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.630
chief designer behind
a new robot drive system.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.686
And that enabled us to compete in robot
competitions, such as Battle Bots.

00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:20.558
&gt;&gt; Great, these guys are from
Silicon Valley, and they mean business,

00:17:20.558 --> 00:17:22.223
look at this bad boy, how heavy is that?

00:17:22.223 --> 00:17:23.617
&gt;&gt; 350 pounds.

00:17:23.617 --> 00:17:26.368
&gt;&gt; Drillzilla just has too much power.

00:17:26.368 --> 00:17:29.089
&gt;&gt; He's twice the weight because-
&gt;&gt; We got second place in the world

00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:31.399
championship in Robot Wars.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.198
If you think about fighting robots,

00:17:33.198 --> 00:17:36.853
where you're actually controlling
them through remote control device,

00:17:36.853 --> 00:17:39.885
the next logical step is that for
vehicle that drives itself.

00:17:39.885 --> 00:17:43.112
[MUSIC]

00:17:43.112 --> 00:17:46.590
&gt;&gt; Instead of lasers, the Hall brothers
experimented with video camera.

00:17:47.589 --> 00:17:52.224
Inspired by the way humans see,
the technique is called stereo vision.

00:17:52.224 --> 00:17:55.192
[MUSIC]

00:17:55.192 --> 00:17:59.069
On the roof,
they mounted two cameras side by side.

00:17:59.069 --> 00:18:02.936
By measuring the lateral shift
of specific areas in each image,

00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:05.659
the robot compute
the distance of objects and

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.611
creates a difference map
to avoid hitting them.

00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:11.796
[MUSIC]

00:18:11.796 --> 00:18:12.772
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:18:12.771 --> 00:18:16.250
[SOUND] [LAUGH] Sweet.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:21.733
&gt;&gt; Even after decades of research,
stereo vision is an unproven technology,

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:25.343
and at higher speeds,
notoriously unreliable.

00:18:29.963 --> 00:18:33.198
Sorry.

00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:37.329
&gt;&gt; After a few scares, the Hall
brothers scrapped stereo vision, and

00:18:37.328 --> 00:18:39.876
started building their spinning laser.

In the fields of Iowa, team TerraMax
is a group of defense contractors.

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:51.259
Like all competitors,

00:18:51.259 --> 00:18:55.529
they're not allowed to use government
money to compete in the Grand Challenge.

00:18:55.529 --> 00:18:58.849
Still, for them, this is no hobby.

00:18:58.849 --> 00:19:04.069
Their vehicle is a big yellow goose
that might lay a giant golden egg.

00:19:04.069 --> 00:19:07.299
TerraMax is a six wheel drive vehicle.

00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:10.819
It is really the logistical
backbone of the Marine Core.

00:19:10.819 --> 00:19:13.839
And we think it's one of the most
mobile vehicles in the world.

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:20.029
&gt;&gt; Oshkosh has sold more than 6,000
of these trucks to the military.

00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:23.920
With the prowess of an Olympic athlete,
it plunges into water,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.550
charges up hills, and
even takes to the air.

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:30.774
So it's got the muscle,
but what about the brains?

00:19:30.775 --> 00:19:35.968
[SOUND] Without a driver, TerraMax is

00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:41.670
more of a timid giant

Making autonomous vehicles

00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:09.124
apparently not tough enough for
Anthony Levandowski,

00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:13.776

into a two-wheeled balancing act.

&gt;&gt; I think the team's did
great the first time around,

Some missing science to
actually win this race,

But Thrun has little
interest in hardware, and

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.490
convinced Volkswagen to donate
a vehicle with steering, brake, and

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.798
shift actuators that can
be controlled by computer.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.420
&gt;&gt; The vehicle's name is Stanley,
so Stanley is nothing else but

Stanford, but
it also gives the vehicle a personality.

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:53.349
We think of the vehicle more and
more as a intelligent decision maker.

00:22:53.349 --> 00:22:57.609
&gt;&gt; Thrun is a computer scientist with
a deep interest in machine learning, and

00:22:57.609 --> 00:23:00.779
robots with personality
are his specialty.

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:05.606
His robots assist the elderly, conduct
museum tours, fetch tennis balls,

00:23:05.606 --> 00:23:10.004
and each one embodies Thrun's desire
to create machines that think.

00:23:10.005 --> 00:23:12.207
[MUSIC]

00:23:12.207 --> 00:23:16.660
&gt;&gt; Sebastian Thrun is interested
in the science of robotics.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.029
In learning about new
techniques that can make,

00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:26.569
robots do fantastically advanced things
ten, 20, even 50 years from now.

00:23:26.569 --> 00:23:29.339
&gt;&gt; I guess he's mounted them vertically,
but we have no data so far, right?

00:23:29.339 --> 00:23:29.769
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:23:29.769 --> 00:23:31.569
&gt;&gt; And
we have no software that can do it.

00:23:31.569 --> 00:23:33.694
Okay, so how foolish of us?

00:23:33.694 --> 00:23:36.030
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Compared to the Red Team,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.230
Stanford is a small group with
a single focus on software.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.701
&gt;&gt; The problem is, based on-
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]

00:23:41.701 --> 00:23:42.630
&gt;&gt; There's a good number of teams

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.830
who think the challenge
lies in the hardware.

00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:47.089
And God bless them,
it's great they're doing this,

00:23:47.089 --> 00:23:48.819
and I know there's other challenges.

00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:51.859
We, from the very beginning,

00:23:51.859 --> 00:23:56.129
pursued a very aggressive timeline to
focus almost entirely on software.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.730
&gt;&gt; Stanford uses the same laser
hardware as the Red Team.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.460
But they're experimenting
with ways to use software

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.269
to give their robot a greater
role in making decisions.

00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:09.750
About speed and safety.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.900
&gt;&gt; So in this display,
the white area is safe to drive,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.820
the red area is unsafe to drive, and
the grey area is you don't know.

00:24:19.049 --> 00:24:22.720
And the robot then just has to steer
itself so that it stays in the middle of

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.600
the road and avoids this red
stuff as much as possible.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.065
&gt;&gt; To test Stanley's software on
the original racecourse, the team has

00:24:33.065 --> 00:24:36.539
traveled to the Mojave Desert where
the first Grand Challenge began.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:42.630
Most of Stanley's computer code has
been written by Mike Montemerlo,

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.670
Red Whitaker's former PhD student.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.440
&gt;&gt; Give me steering and throttle.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.150
&gt;&gt; Steering's yours.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.644
Throttle.

00:24:49.644 --> 00:24:51.941
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:24:51.941 --> 00:24:52.339
Great.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:55.890
&gt;&gt; Let's step to 15 now.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.231
&gt;&gt; What's the mile marker?

00:25:00.231 --> 00:25:01.046
&gt;&gt; 7.28.

00:25:01.046 --> 00:25:03.519
&gt;&gt; 7.3 is the critical place.

00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:06.089
In fact,
right after this turn over here,

00:25:06.089 --> 00:25:11.549
the red team rode off the road and there
was this final destination in the race.

00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:13.240
That's a very exciting place for us.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.170
It's in many many ways
a historical place.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.289
This is the end of
the previous Grand Challenge.

00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:18.950
&gt;&gt; Swerve to the right.

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:21.779
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:22.889
I be having a problem.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.560
&gt;&gt; It's the end of the race for us.

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:24.889
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.110
&gt;&gt; What happened Mike?

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:33.879
&gt;&gt; It just, the long lasers can't
see their blind in a corner.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:38.145
&gt;&gt; It stuck the force of a software bug
which we're currently debugging, so our

00:25:38.144 --> 00:25:42.162
challenge between April now and October
will be to get rid of these bugs.

00:25:42.162 --> 00:25:45.560
[MUSIC]

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.610
&gt;&gt; Unbelievably Stanley Faulter did the
same place that killed the Red Team in

00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:51.440
the first Grand Challenge.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.410
But is confident about going head to
head against a team he knows well.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.040
&gt;&gt; The Red Team is
a seasoned competitor, and

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:02.299
they have a lot of money,
a lot of equipment.

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:05.889
They have a fantastic team,
they used to be at Carnegie Mellon,

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.900
I know Red very well,
he's an amazing person.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.820
I wouldn't be surprised if the Red
team and the Stanford team, and

00:26:12.819 --> 00:26:15.847
maybe two of the other teams
were the big teams in the end.

00:26:15.847 --> 00:26:19.367
[SOUND] We will see,
it's a race, it's a true race.

00:26:19.367 --> 00:26:24.341
[NOISE]
&gt;&gt; The Red Team is teaching its

00:26:24.342 --> 00:26:27.099
robot to go fast,
up to 50 miles an hour.

00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:33.089
Software guru, Kevin Peterson,
has been spending long days and

00:26:33.089 --> 00:26:36.419
nights improving Sandstorm's
performance at race pace.

00:26:38.359 --> 00:26:41.929
&gt;&gt; We've been working on Sandstorm for
the last month.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.279
I just cut sleep out,
you know, it's not that tough.

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:48.399
[LAUGH] You get three hours of sleep a
day and drink some coffee, you're okay.

00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:52.440
&gt;&gt; As the robot drives,

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.826
it has to constantly update its
picture of the terrain ahead.

00:26:54.826 --> 00:26:59.870
The faster it goes, the faster it
has to update this picture, or

00:26:59.869 --> 00:27:01.519
the terrain just gets on top of it.

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:07.289
This is easy for humans to do because we
can see out 300, 400, 500 feet ahead.

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:11.190
But robots have sensors like lasers
that operate at fixed ranges,

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.160
60 feet, at most, 150 feet.

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:17.690
It's like driving through a fog.

00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:24.258
&gt;&gt; Each team must lift
this fog to win the race

00:27:25.407 --> 00:27:27.049
&gt;&gt; The Red Team's secret weapon

00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:30.139
is hidden inside the dome
on Sandstorm's roof,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.509
where a high powered laser is
mounted on a device called a gimbal.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.670
&gt;&gt; The gimbal is a motion platform

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.789
that's a little bit
like an animal's neck.

00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:47.865
It can point sensors left,
right, up, down,

00:27:47.865 --> 00:27:56.319
in such a way that the pounding
motion from the vehicle is smoothed.

00:27:56.319 --> 00:27:59.108
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Like binoculars,

00:27:59.108 --> 00:28:03.009
this special laser can see
into the far distance.

00:28:03.009 --> 00:28:06.700
By damping vibration the gimbal
gives it a steady gaze.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.710
And can point it to
follow turns in the road.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:13.930
[SOUND] The gimbal mounted laser
is unique to the Red Team,

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.421
which has made several from scratch.

00:28:17.421 --> 00:28:21.930
But it's a fancy piece of hardware
that's hard to build and easy to break.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.349
&gt;&gt; There's been a lot of discussion
whether you want to gimbal your sensors.

00:28:27.349 --> 00:28:29.419
In fact,
we've actually decided against it.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.070
We decided against it because we
wanted simplicity in the system.

00:28:33.069 --> 00:28:35.906
Every physical system
that moves can break and

00:28:35.906 --> 00:28:38.750
there's a lot of stuff
you can do in software.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.287
[MUSIC]

00:28:41.287 --> 00:28:45.513
&gt;&gt; The Stanford team is putting its
hopes in a set of off the shelf lasers

00:28:45.512 --> 00:28:48.720
linked through software
to a simple video camera.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.299
The camera can see all
the way to the horizon.

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:58.809
The trick is to give Stanley some way to
distinguish the road in the video image.

00:28:58.809 --> 00:29:02.379
&gt;&gt; So this is just one laser you
can see it steer the vehicle.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:07.400
&gt;&gt; Stanley's lasers pinpoint smooth
terrain right in front of the vehicle.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.110
By overlapping the laser and video data,
Stanley can identify the color of

00:29:12.109 --> 00:29:16.009
the smooth area and search for
it in the rest of the video image.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.560
The area Stanley believes is
safe is now shown in red.

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:27.539
By matching laser and video data on the
fly, Stanley can adapt to changing road

00:29:27.539 --> 00:29:31.519
conditions and determine safe
driving speeds all by itself.

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:37.709
&gt;&gt; Making a car really intelligent
requires to give it an ability to adapt.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.920
It's just like in human life,
we don't enable kids to have a rule for

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.480
every contingency.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.306
You tell them how to learn from
contingencies and make them smarter, and

00:29:46.306 --> 00:29:47.432
then we trust them to learn.

00:29:47.432 --> 00:29:49.526
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:29:49.526 --> 00:29:54.519
&gt;&gt; Stanford is the only team using
adaptive vision to achieve race speeds.

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:58.952
Whether it will work well enough for the
Grand Challenge will soon become clear.

00:29:58.952 --> 00:30:05.037

after more than a year of fevered
preparations, the Grand Challenge is on.

Advance Research Projects Agency,

are judging the final runs
of the qualifying event.

00:30:21.339 --> 00:30:24.459
43 teams are competing for

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:29.960
just 20 slots in the second and perhaps
final Grand Challenge desert race.

Miraculously, Highlander is back
in action though hardly tested.

00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:33.383
First carrier.

00:33:33.383 --> 00:33:37.534
It has a shaky start but
over the course of 3 runs Highlander

00:33:37.534 --> 00:33:41.449
clocks the fastest times of
any robot at the qualifier.

00:33:41.449 --> 00:33:45.717

00:33:45.717 --> 00:33:46.565

00:33:53.084 --> 00:33:54.637
Fucking sweet, man.

[LAUGH].

00:33:58.878 --> 00:34:00.964
And Henley.

00:34:00.964 --> 00:34:05.740
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; A first time competitor

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.949
Stanley is an unknown quantity.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:10.730
No one knows what to expect.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.380
The robot passes cleanly
through the first gate.

00:34:18.559 --> 00:34:22.295
It shows impressive speed
on the back stretch but

00:34:22.295 --> 00:34:24.579
is not as fast as Highlander.

00:34:24.579 --> 00:34:27.463
Like a proud parent, Sebastian
records the moment for posterity.

00:34:27.463 --> 00:34:28.592
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:34:28.592 --> 00:34:29.480
So far so good.

&gt;&gt; Yes.

DARPA announces who qualified and
what the starting order will be.

00:35:09.619 --> 00:35:12.255
&gt;&gt; Highlander is number
one on Saturday morning.

00:35:12.255 --> 00:35:17.242
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Stanford number two on

00:35:17.242 --> 00:35:18.329

[MUSIC]

00:35:30.974 --> 00:35:34.177
&gt;&gt; The race course is a circular
maze that zig zags for

00:35:34.177 --> 00:35:38.838
132 miles across the Mojave dessert
near the out skirts of Las Vegas.

00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:43.269
It's mostly flat, but rough and unpaved.

00:35:44.389 --> 00:35:51.569
It includes tunnels, cattle gates,
and steep mountain switchbacks.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:56.696
With a 10 hour time limit the race
will demand speed, agility and

00:35:56.695 --> 00:36:00.464
endurance that no machine has
ever demonstrated on its own.

00:36:00.465 --> 00:36:03.746
[MUSIC]

00:36:03.746 --> 00:36:06.440
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:11.429
The exact route is a deeply guarded
secret but now at 4AM on race day,

00:36:11.429 --> 00:36:13.590
it's released to the teams.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.650
&gt;&gt; Good Luck
&gt;&gt; Thanks

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.039
&gt;&gt; On a compact disc

00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:21.150
is a road map defined by
2900 GPS weigh points.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.989
&gt;&gt; All your hopes and
dreams are on this disc.

00:36:24.889 --> 00:36:27.969
&gt;&gt; Teams have two hours
to analyze the map and

00:36:27.969 --> 00:36:30.480
plug it into their robots
before the race begins.

00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:36.079
In several minutes the Stanford team
loads the course into their robot.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:41.995
Stanley will choose its own speeds
on the fly adapting to different

00:36:41.994 --> 00:36:43.284
types of terrain.

00:36:43.284 --> 00:36:44.646
[MUSIC]

00:36:44.646 --> 00:36:47.059
The red team takes a far
different approach.

00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:50.699
Concealed in their trailer,

00:36:50.699 --> 00:36:53.129
Whittaker's troops look like
they're planning an attack.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.469
The race course is layered
on top of elevation data and

00:36:58.469 --> 00:37:01.169
satellite images stored in
the red team's computers.

00:37:03.949 --> 00:37:06.210
&gt;&gt; The route is broken into sections and

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:09.889
distributed to team members who
will examine it in minute detail.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.500
Thousands of wave points are added
to fill gaps in DARPA's map.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.349
And each point can be adjusted
to optimize the robot's path.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.088
Speeds are set for
every inch of terrain.

00:37:25.088 --> 00:37:27.820
Right where you are,
right where you are, just do.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:31.970
&gt;&gt; Red believes his robots must have
as much information as possible to gain

00:37:31.969 --> 00:37:34.579
the winning edge.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:39.320
&gt;&gt; Our preference is to err
in the direction of overkill.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:43.650
I wouldn't want to reflect Sunday
morning that we lowballed it.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:46.869
&gt;&gt; It is slow.

00:37:46.869 --> 00:37:47.589
It is flat.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.120
It is.

00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:53.219
&gt;&gt; On a course that appears easy,
Red makes a critical decision.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.769
&gt;&gt; So here is the punch line.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:01.369
&gt;&gt; He decides to run Highlander
at a fast and risky pace.

00:38:01.369 --> 00:38:06.244
Sandstorm will be the tortoise running
40 minutes slower in the hope that at

00:38:06.244 --> 00:38:08.652
least one Red team robot will finish.

A far cry from the first Grand Challenge

It just stopped moving and slid back
down to the bottom of the hill.

00:44:55.409 --> 00:45:01.809
records a milestone event.

00:45:01.809 --> 00:45:02.782
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

00:45:02.782 --> 00:45:04.518
&gt;&gt; Stanley has passed Highlander.

00:45:04.518 --> 00:45:13.824
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:45:13.824 --> 00:45:17.230
&gt;&gt; Satnley's

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:20.978
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; At that point,

00:45:20.978 --> 00:45:23.400
we pretty much Highlander
wasn't going to win the race.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.088
We thought Sandstorm might have
a chance, it was really disappointing.

00:45:27.088 --> 00:45:29.687
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:45:29.686 --> 00:45:31.750
[MUSIC]

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.103
&gt;&gt; Five hours after
leaving the starting line,

00:45:35.103 --> 00:45:40.231
Stanley now leads the pack and
just five robots remain on the course.

00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:44.513
To finish they must wind through
a treacherous mountain pass, and

00:45:44.512 --> 00:45:47.578
Stanley must now make life or
death decisions.

00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:56.214
[MUSIC]

00:45:56.213 --> 00:46:00.612
Somehow Highlander has managed to
reach the summit of the pass, but

00:46:00.612 --> 00:46:04.460
the gimble is turned sideways and
appears to be dead.

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.250
Without its secret weapon,
it must rely on short range lasers and

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.806
GPS to avoid disaster.

00:46:10.806 --> 00:46:14.126
[MUSIC]

00:46:14.126 --> 00:46:19.117
Right behind Highlander,
Sandstorm is in good shape,

00:46:19.117 --> 00:46:22.630
but driving slowly according to plan.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:32.630
[MUSIC]

00:46:35.844 --> 00:46:38.380
The crowd gathers.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.333
A blue dot appears in the distance.

00:46:40.333 --> 00:46:42.530
[MUSIC]

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:50.219
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:46:50.219 --> 00:46:53.128
&gt;&gt; After driving 6 hours and

00:46:53.128 --> 00:46:59.218
53 minutes at an average
speed of 19 miles an hour.

00:46:59.217 --> 00:47:03.186
Stanley is about to become the first
vehicle in history to drive 132 miles by

00:47:03.186 --> 00:47:03.673
itself.

00:47:03.673 --> 00:47:13.673
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:47:24.197 --> 00:47:25.679
&gt;&gt; 25, Red team 2,

00:47:25.679 --> 00:47:30.564
Highlander from Pittsburgh, PA,
Carnegie Mellon University,

00:47:30.563 --> 00:47:35.135
the Red team 2 is alliance
&gt;&gt; 21 minutes behind Stanley,

00:47:35.135 --> 00:47:37.329
Highlander limps to the finish.

00:47:37.329 --> 00:47:41.862
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:47:41.862 --> 00:47:47.499
[MUSIC]

00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:51.394
&gt;&gt; Minutes later the trustee
veteran appears.

00:47:51.394 --> 00:47:53.788
&gt;&gt; Spot number 19, Sandstorm.

00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:56.082
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:47:56.081 --> 00:48:05.766
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:05.766 --> 00:48:16.211
[MUSIC]

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.460
You don't need us?

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.959
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.710
&gt;&gt; It was just amazing to see

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:25.481
this community of people,
that community succeeded today.

00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:30.429
Behind me there are three Volvos that
made it all the way to the desert.

00:48:30.429 --> 00:48:32.929
And all three of them
did the unthinkable.

00:48:32.929 --> 00:48:35.759
It's such a fantastic success for
this community.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.685
I think we all win.

00:48:36.684 --> 00:48:42.012
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Before announcing the winner,

00:48:42.012 --> 00:48:45.635
DARPA officials honor
the five finishing teams.

00:48:45.635 --> 00:48:48.905
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; TerraMax is fifth.

00:48:48.905 --> 00:48:52.170
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; A dark horse,

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.204
the gray team from
New Orleans is fourth.

00:48:55.204 --> 00:48:59.610
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Highlander is third.

00:49:02.079 --> 00:49:07.894
Sandstorm, Whitaker's tortoise,
was just 11 minutes behind the winner.

00:49:07.894 --> 00:49:10.434
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; So I guess it's time.

00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:15.641
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; The check goes to Stanley.

00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:21.088
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; So

00:49:21.088 --> 00:49:22.695
if someone from Stanley,
will please come up here.

00:49:22.695 --> 00:49:27.691
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; What Stanford did in

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:32.819
a short span of time is
amazing in robotics world.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.440
On this scale of time to develop
a system this sophisticated that can

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:41.490
navigate so well over such a wide
variety of terrain at such high speeds.

00:49:41.489 --> 00:49:43.889
It really is worth its
place in the history books.

00:49:43.889 --> 00:49:49.228
[MUSIC]

00:49:49.228 --> 00:49:52.599
&gt;&gt; The source of Highlander's
problems remains a mystery.

00:49:52.599 --> 00:49:54.809
That may have been
the result of its roll over.

00:49:56.099 --> 00:49:57.880
&gt;&gt; The engine punked on us.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:03.811
The only thing that was short was not
having a top-end speed on the gas pedal.

00:50:03.811 --> 00:50:08.910
Except for that, ran like a charm.

00:50:08.909 --> 00:50:10.799
&gt;&gt; This really was like a horse race.

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:15.289
They finished in such close times.

00:50:15.289 --> 00:50:18.815
So, the red team is
justifiably proud for

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:22.650
having both of its robots
finish the course.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:27.269
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Many believe the completion

00:50:27.269 --> 00:50:32.250
of the grand challenge is a giant step
that will push robots out of the lab and

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:33.349
into the real world.

00:50:35.039 --> 00:50:38.829
The forces that will make this happen
are embodied in the passion and

00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:40.289
vision of two men.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:45.330
&gt;&gt; The world needs both
Sebastian Thrun's and Brent Whitaker's.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.590
If robotics is ever going to become
part of the daily fabric of our lives,

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:54.390
it needs those scientists who can
come up with those far out ideas for

00:50:54.389 --> 00:50:57.719
how machines are actually going
to start to think, to reason.

00:50:57.719 --> 00:51:00.751
[MUSIC]

00:51:00.751 --> 00:51:03.733
And it also needs the builders,
the implementors, and

00:51:03.733 --> 00:51:06.849
those who are driven to make
things work in the real world.

00:51:06.849 --> 00:51:10.146
[MUSIC]

00:51:10.146 --> 00:51:14.087
&gt;&gt; There's every reason to believe all
those who participated will continue

00:51:14.088 --> 00:51:18.290
their quest to innovate even though the
grand challenge itself is now history.

00:51:18.289 --> 00:51:22.757
[MUSIC]

00:51:22.757 --> 00:51:24.450
So what about the future?

00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:29.730
Will mechanical warriors
take over the battlefield?

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:33.117
[MUSIC]

00:51:33.117 --> 00:51:36.730
Will we all be passengers on
the highways of tomorrow?

00:51:39.735 --> 00:51:44.890
Someday the great robot race may
well be remembered as a moment when

00:51:44.889 --> 00:51:51.129
the partnership between humans and the
machines we create was forever changed.
