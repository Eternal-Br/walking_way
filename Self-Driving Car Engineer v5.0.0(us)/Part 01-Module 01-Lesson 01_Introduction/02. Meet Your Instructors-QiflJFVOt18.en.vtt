00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.180
&gt;&gt; Here are my colleagues, David and Ryan.

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:09.429
David used to work at Ford as

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.320
a self-driving car engineer before he joined Udacity as an instructor,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.679
and Ryan is a recovering astrophysicist

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.477
who was looking for self-driving car in outer space,

00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:19.423
couldn't find them, and joined us as an instructor here at Udacity.

00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:21.339
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Thanks, Sebastian.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.329
So, the most exciting part of this course is that at the end of the course,

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.104
you'll be able to put your own code on a real self-driving car.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:31.420
In fact, it's that car right there behind us.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.410
&gt;&gt; That's right. So welcome to the program.

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:37.139
You and I are going to be learning together to write code to drive a car.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.160
We're gonna have David and Sebastian looking after us,

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.574
and we'll be bringing in industry experts to join us in the classroom as well.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.520
So let's get started. All right.
