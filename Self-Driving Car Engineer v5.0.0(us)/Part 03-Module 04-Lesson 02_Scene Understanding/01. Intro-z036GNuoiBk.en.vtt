00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.444
Welcome to scene understanding.

00:00:02.444 --> 00:00:06.914
In this lesson you'll learn how to extract meaning from an image.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:08.835
We'll discuss object detection,

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:14.810
semantic segmentation and the intersection over union metric, sometimes called IOU.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.280
We will cap off this lesson with the walk through of

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.000
a fully convolutional network for semantic segmentation. Let's get started.
