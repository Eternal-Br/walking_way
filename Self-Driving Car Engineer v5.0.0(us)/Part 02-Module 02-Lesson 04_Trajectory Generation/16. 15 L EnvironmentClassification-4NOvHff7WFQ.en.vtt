00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Correct, you've just implemented Hybrid A* which is one of

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.464
the best algorithm for finding trajectories in unstructured environments.

00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:11.390
An example of such an environment is a parking lot or a maze.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.310
And these environments tend to have

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.490
less specific rules than highway or streets and also, lower driving speeds.

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.334
They also do not have an obvious reference path

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:25.830
that corresponds to what we should be driving 90% of the time,

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.959
because they change so much.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.603
On the other hand, highway or

00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:34.820
streets are very structured environments and in these environments,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.770
all motion is more constrained by predefined rules,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.170
regarding how we can move on the road.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.844
For example, the direction of traffic or lane boundaries or also speed limits.

00:00:46.844 --> 00:00:50.129
All these rules impose constraints which have to be

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.740
satisfied but also for guidance regarding what the trajectory should look like.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.465
And while a style is great at finding solutions everywhere,

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:03.480
it does not take advantage of this information.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.155
For example, the road structure itself can be used as a reference path.

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:09.769
Let's see how we can u-
