00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
I'm proud of your work on behavior selection,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.339
but now we're going to go a level lower,

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.480
where we actually want to find a specific trajectory that the car can take.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.925
A trajectory is not just a curve that the car can follow

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:16.060
but also a time sequence in which we say how fast the car should go.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.969
In finding trajectory, there are many many important things to watch out for.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.289
The most important one is don't crash,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.134
don't collide with something else.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.975
But also important is things like passenger comfort, right?

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:29.460
So you don't want to do crazy joke,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.859
a trajectory that passes both back and forth.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.880
You want to make this smooth and elegant as possible.
