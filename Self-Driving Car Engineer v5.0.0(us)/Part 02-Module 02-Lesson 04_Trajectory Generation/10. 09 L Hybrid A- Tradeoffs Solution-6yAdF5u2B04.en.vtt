00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
Now, unlike regular A*,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.850
Hybrid A* is a continuous method.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.970
Since, the configuration that will end up being part of

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.890
the trajectory are not part of a predefined discrete set.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.242
Similarly to A*, Hybrid A* star also uses an optimistic heuristic.

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:21.770
But one sacrifice made with Hybrid A*

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.525
is that it does not always find a solution when one exists.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:29.145
Indeed, the completeness is sacrificed

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:32.305
because we only allow one continuous configuration per discrete cell.

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:38.100
The great improvement compared with A* is that the solution it does find are

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.000
guaranteed to be driveable, though not necessarily optimal.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.040
Compare these to the properties of A*.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.320
With Hybrid A*, we have lost completeness and optimality guarantees in favor of drivability.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.690
In practice, however, this algorithm is very

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.000
efficient at finding good path almost all the time.
