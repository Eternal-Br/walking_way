00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
As we continue this lesson,

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:05.570
we'll be relying heavily on Frenet coordinates.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.220
And as a reminder of how these work,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.175
we can first look at the road in Cartesian coordinates,

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:16.635
where we imagine the road leaving on some rectangular X, Y grid.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.630
And you can imagine that the more complex the road shape,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.615
the harder our problem.

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:26.210
Think of how complicated both the X and Y behavior

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.945
would look like just to describe a car going along the lane.

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:32.104
If we were to compute that trajectory,

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:34.280
we would be pretty much be computing the shape of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.600
the road whereas this information is already available.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.290
So instead we use a Frenet coordinate system where the S coordinate depicts motion along

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.305
the road also called longitudinal motion

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:52.640
and the D coordinate gives side to side or lateral motion.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.150
Before we move on, I want you to realize that

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.320
although we can simply take the center of a lane as a reference line,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.745
we could also imagine using an actual nice and feasible trajectory

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:09.635
computed with an offline planning algorithm like A* or Hybrid A*.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:13.120
And that trajectory would have been later smooth.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.220
The benefit of this is that it would allow us to have

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.865
a nominal path that we know the vehicle should follow if possible,

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:23.000
like when the corresponding portion of the lane in front of us is empty.
