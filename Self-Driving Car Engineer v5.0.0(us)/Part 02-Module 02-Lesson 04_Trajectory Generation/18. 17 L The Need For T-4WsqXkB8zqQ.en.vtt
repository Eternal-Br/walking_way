00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Now I'm going to emphasize why it is

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.630
important to not just compute a sequence of configurations,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.465
but also to decide when we're going to be in each configuration.

00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:14.130
So let's say I told you that some car recently

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.610
drove along this road following this trajectory.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.720
If I asked you to describe what the driver did,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.400
you might be tempted to say that they passed the slow moving vehicle or maybe,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.595
you think they swerved to avoid a pothole.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:33.437
Well, let me tell you what actually happened up here,

00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:35.880
we had a broken down vehicle stopped on the road,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.470
and down here we have

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.190
a quickly moving vehicle that will travel the trajectory we just saw.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.130
Now, I'm going to track the location of this vehicle with little blue dots.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.850
Add one here for T equals zero.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.250
In the next time step,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.667
the vehicle has moved forward quite a bit and again and again,

00:00:55.667 --> 00:01:03.340
but this time not as much because it started to slow down and slowing down again.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.970
At this point, this vehicle would

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.780
like to change lane in order to pass the stopped vehicle.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.020
However, at the same moment it senses a vehicle

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.170
arriving behind it in the other lane at high speed.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.570
Therefore, it has to wait until this new car has passed it in order to change

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.715
lane which only gives it the option to come to a full stop and wait.

00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:34.425
T=7, T=8 and T=9 when the red vehicle has passed it.

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:37.860
The blue vehicle decide that it's safe to keep driving.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.345
It does this by turning left and accelerating.

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:43.845
It continues with the lane change maneuver,

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:46.800
until it gets into the left lane where it keeps

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.915
accelerating and accelerating until it gets to highway speed.

00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:54.330
Once it has passed the stop vehicle,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.365
it gets back into the right lane and continues on its way.

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:03.150
I told you this story using discrete time increments,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.984
but the vehicle was following a continuous path that looked something like this.

00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:10.920
If we remove the dots,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.595
we're left with the same path I asked you about in the beginning.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:19.418
The problem was not incorporating timing into our planning,

00:02:19.418 --> 00:02:21.820
is that you don't tell the full story.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.770
You describe the motion of your vehicle in the next few seconds,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.140
but you don't actually specify where

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.580
the vehicle should be at a given time within this time frame.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.785
When we were solving static maze'ss's problems this was fine but highways aren't mazess's.

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:41.610
There is traffic on highways which means that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.525
the traversal space is constantly changing over time.

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:48.814
To avoid collision in dynamic environment,

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:51.035
we need to think about time as well.

00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:57.615
And that means that driving in traffic is fundamentally a three dimensional problem.

00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:00.000
It is important to note that you have

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.405
the same situation if you were using Cartesian coordinates.

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:06.660
For any coordinates help us simplify the problem,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.030
but do not change the nature of the problem,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:22.000
which is planning a trajectory in dynamic environment.
