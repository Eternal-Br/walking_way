00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.304
Here we're not going to discuss how to solve these feasibility check exactly.

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:07.859
But I want to give you a few hints about how to

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.824
do some initial validation for your trajectory.

00:00:10.824 --> 00:00:13.469
In order to do so, we're going to neglect

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.219
the curvature of the road and assume it is locally straight.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.339
Regarding longitudinal acceleration, we make

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.134
the additional assumption that our heading is pretty much aligned with the road.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:29.650
This allows us to say that S doubled dots is the longitude acceleration of the car.

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.614
Therefore, we need to check that at any point of the trajectory,

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:36.120
this acceleration is less than

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.924
the maximum acceleration that the engine would need to supply,

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:43.204
and more than the maximum braking deceleration of the car.

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:45.449
Right now, this could be a fixed value.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.960
In real life however,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.020
this should probably be computed using information about the friction of the road.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.355
Similarly, for lateral acceleration,

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:58.140
we can check that all d double dot values are less than

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.645
a fixed lateral acceleration value that can be set for comfort,

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.814
or to avoid any risk of rollover in our car.

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:10.170
Regarding steering angle, the bicycle model tells us that there's

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.230
a nice relationship between the steering angle of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.465
the car and the radius of the circle of curvature,

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:21.900
where L is the distance between the wheel axis and R is the circle radius.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.270
The curvature is then given by this formula,

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:27.569
and therefore the maximum curvature allowed at

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.804
any point of the trajectory is given by this equation.

00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:33.570
If you remember, in the reading assignment about [inaudible]

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.049
the curvature for path is defined like this,

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.759
where Δφi is the heading difference between two points of

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.064
the trajectory and Δχi is the distance between them.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.359
Finally the velocity is checked against

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.319
values specified by the map or the behavioral layer.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.564
For example, we could use the speed limit of the road in most cases.

00:01:56.564 --> 00:02:00.719
That gives us a maximal velocity but also sometimes,

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.849
we need a minimal velocity like on

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.034
highways where we don't want to drive too slow or we're backing up,

00:02:07.034 --> 00:02:09.030
negative S dot is not allowed.
