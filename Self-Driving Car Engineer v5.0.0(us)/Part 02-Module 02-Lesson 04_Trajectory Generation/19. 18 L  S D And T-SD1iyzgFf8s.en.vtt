00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
Up until now you learn about generating a sequence of configurations

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.105
for vehicle using algorithms like A* and Hybrid A*.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:13.375
We refer to this as path planning. But what about time?

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:16.230
In path planning, we imagine taking

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.335
our driving surface and length some sort of discretized grid on top of it.

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:25.845
Then, we make plans by specifying a start state and a goal state.

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:29.850
And the trajectories we generate looks something like this for algorithms like A*

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.470
or something like this for algorithms like Hybrid A*.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.260
These algorithms play an important role in autonomous driving.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.950
But the path they generate don't really take predictions into account.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.840
For example, let's project back to when the blue vehicle first wanted to change lane.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.465
Here we will include the time as a third dimension.

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:55.170
One way to visualize it is to imagine looking at the road

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.825
from some angle and time would be the dimension going up.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:03.150
And one way for a vehicle to move along the path that goes around the start vehicle,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.125
would be something like that.

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:08.940
The fast moving vehicle we perceived behind us is predicted to

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.460
move in on the lane at a fast speed which would look something like that.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.815
And that's how we know that we cannot change lane immediately.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:19.980
If we try to go before the vehicle that passed us,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.535
which is another red Polygram in the two dimension.

00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:26.210
We will collide with the vehicle.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.740
We have to wait for this vehicle to drive past us.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.395
Once the Red car has passed us,

00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:33.720
we can proceed with our lane change

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.570
Now as you can see, having a path is nice,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.230
but it is not sufficient to solve the planning problem when there are

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.210
dynamic objects around us which in autonomous driving is all the time.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.909
Therefore, we have to plan not only a sequence of configuration,

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.910
sd and fita but also have these configurations all set up in time.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.675
The trajectory is a function which for

00:01:56.675 --> 00:02:00.785
any time t associates a configuration of a vehicle.

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:03.780
Now, we need a way to generate such a trajectory.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.790
And the way we're going to do this,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.540
is by separating the planning we do in the S dimension,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.955
from the planning we do in a d dimension.

00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:15.731
Instead of thinking about one picture in three dimension,

00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:18.840
we usually decide to reason about two pictures.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.840
Each of which is in two dimensions.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.250
I'm going to walk you through

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.975
the same vehicle tracking exercise I did in the previous video, two more times.

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:33.615
One for s and one for d. Let's start with s. At t=0.

00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:36.520
The vehicle is here at s=0.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.655
Then at t=1, it's here.

00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:45.860
And it keeps moving until it reaches the situation where it goes to a full stop.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.840
Note that we can see the vehicle has stopped by looking at this graph.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.295
Here we can see a flat slope and the flat slopes means no movement.

00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:57.535
This is something we couldn't see in that t

00:02:57.535 --> 00:03:00.890
over s graph that we used before to represent a path.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.300
Then the vehicle starts moving again until it reaches its final configuration at t=15.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.838
Now, let's do the same thing for d versus

00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:15.515
t. As we move along the road, d remains constant.

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:22.700
Then the vehicle goes to a full stop and after the stop, start shifting left.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.900
And after it has passed the green vehicle,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.650
it goes back to its original lane.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.220
Finally, we can look at both trajectories

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.980
simultaneously and the great thing is that we can

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.160
finally visualize the whole motion of the car over time.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.250
It's not just a path now,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.190
it's a trajectory and we can fully describe what the vehicle did within these 15 seconds.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.000
Next, I'm going to ask you to think about some questions involving graphs like these.
