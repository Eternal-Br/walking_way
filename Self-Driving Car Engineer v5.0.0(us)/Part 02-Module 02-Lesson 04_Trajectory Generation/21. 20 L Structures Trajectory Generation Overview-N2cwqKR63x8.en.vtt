00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
In the next few segments,

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.040
I'm going to present a method for trajectory planning that

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.714
is useful in structured environments like highway driving.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:12.419
To do that, I'll introduce the idea of Jerk minimization to

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.890
generate a nice trajectory from a start configuration to a goal configuration.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.929
I will show you how to generate Jerk minimizing trajectories using polynomials and then

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.420
present a brief derivation on how to compute

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.120
the coefficients of the polynomial that solves our problem.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.710
Then I will show you an example of what one such trajectory looks like on

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.539
the highway and how we can evaluate

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.210
its drive-ability and compare it to other trajectories.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.350
Finally, I will show you how by generating many similar jerk minimizing

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.465
trajectories we can compare them

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:49.150
and select the best one for the situation we want to drive through.
