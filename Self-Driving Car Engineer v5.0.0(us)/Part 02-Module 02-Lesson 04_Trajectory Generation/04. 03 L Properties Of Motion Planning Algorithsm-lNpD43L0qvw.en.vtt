00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
When discussing planning algorithms,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:05.910
there are two important properties that we like to talk about.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.384
The first one is called completeness.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:12.539
And this means that if a solution exists through the multiplying problem,

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.589
the planner will find it.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.515
And if a solution does not exist,

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.245
the planner will terminate and report that no solution exists.

00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:23.650
So, consider the following two situations.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:28.984
In the first one, the complete algorithm might correctly identify this as a solution.

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:30.644
and the second one,

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:34.950
the algorithm would terminates and tell us there is no solution.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.425
Now, there may be something bothering you

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:40.614
about the solution identified in the first example.

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:44.219
Which brings us to the second property, optimality.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.579
A planning algorithm is optimal if it always

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.629
return the sequence which minimizes some cost function.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.950
So if we're using total distance traveled as a cost function for example,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.030
then this would be an optimal solution while this would not.
