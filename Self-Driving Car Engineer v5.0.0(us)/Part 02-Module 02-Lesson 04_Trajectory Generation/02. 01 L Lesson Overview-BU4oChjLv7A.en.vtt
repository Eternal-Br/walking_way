00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
Hi, I'm Emmanuel. And in this lesson,

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.669
I'm going to teach you about continuous trajectory planning.

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.164
And more specifically, how to generate drivable trajectories.

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:15.434
Before we begin, let me give you a quick overview of the lesson.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:18.780
First, we will define what the motion planning problem is

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.754
and discuss a few important concepts and priorities regarding motion planning algorithms.

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.704
Then we'll do a quick review of A*

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:32.094
to get you ready for the first new algorithm we will cover which is called Hybrid A*.

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:37.405
As name suggests, Hybrid A* isn't purely discrete or continues.

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:41.924
Next, we explore sampling based method called polynomial trajectory generation,

00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:45.119
which is really useful for highway driving.

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:47.948
Before we dive into how to actually make the car drive,

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:51.520
let's take a minute to formally define the motion planning problem.
