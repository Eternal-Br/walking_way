00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.335
What is a jerk minimizing trajectory?

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.430
An interesting and useful fact to us is that it is

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.820
relatively easy to compute a jerk optimal trajectory in one dimension.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.465
In fact, consider a function s of t different from time zero to time tf.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:19.680
and recall that jerk is a third relative of position.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.290
So the total jerk accumulated over

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.700
the duration of this trajectory is given by this equation.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.270
And here, we want to analyze both positive and negative jerk.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.720
Therefore, we're going to look at total square jerk.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.015
Our problem is then to find a function s of t that minimizes this integral.

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:41.670
If we go through the math required to find the minimum,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.330
you'll find that all the time derivatives of s of order

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.470
six and more have to be zero in order for S to be jerk minimal.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.845
Now, we can also use a helpful fact about functions,

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:59.910
which is that any function can be written like this or more compactly like this.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.970
When you take this form of s and add in

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.575
the information that we have about it's time derivative, you find this.

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:09.270
All of the coefficient bigger than five or zero,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.920
which means that all minimum jerk trajectories

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
can be represented as a fifth order polynomial like this.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.560
You can see this equation has six coefficients and six coefficients means

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.780
six tuneable parameters that we can choose

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.675
from in order to define the shape of a 1D trajectory.

00:01:28.675 --> 00:01:34.055
And in practice, we use them to specify the boundary conditions of our trajectory.

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:37.740
The things we'd like to constrain are the initial position, velocity,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.860
and acceleration as well as the final position, velocity and acceleration.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.780
Now, this is just the 1D representing the longitude of displacement.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.145
But, the same for the lateral displacement applies.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.590
This gives us 12 variables to pick in order to fully

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.489
define the motion of our vehicle in S&amp;D over time.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.460
The initial state of our vehicle give us

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.750
the longitudinal and lateral boundary conditions t equals zero,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.960
and we get to pick the end boundary condition.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.445
I'm going to show you plots of what lateral trajectories look like for a simple case,

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:17.880
where a car moves from here to here and make

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.500
the simplifying assumption that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.970
the initial and final lateral velocities and accelerations are zero.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.065
Which is reasonable for lane change.

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.100
Then, all boundary conditions look like this.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.395
And the only nonzero quantity of this 1D problem is the final lateral displacement.

00:02:34.395 --> 00:02:37.260
Let's look at what some of these trajectories look like.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.335
Keep in mind, this is a one dimensional motion.

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:42.810
The X axis here is time and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.835
the Y axis is lateral position of the vehicle as it makes its lane change.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:54.875
The F and T are the final lateral displacements and the duration of our trajectory.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.175
You can see at equal zero,

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:58.155
the position is zero.

00:02:58.155 --> 00:03:02.130
The slope is zero so velocity is now and so is acceleration.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.845
Likewise, for the final position that equals 10.

00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:06.660
And this curves looks pretty smooth.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.249
But let's also look at velocity over time and acceleration over time.

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.610
Although not all of these curves might be meaningful to you,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.345
let's think back about what just happened here.

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:22.020
We've specified a position we wanted to reach and a time we wanted to

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.865
reach it at in some equations and we end up with a nice looking trajectory.

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:30.405
It's very nice indeed because a lot of drivers would not attain

00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:34.435
that level of comfort if we were to ask them to reproduce it.

00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:37.650
Now, let's see what happens if I try to reach the destinations more

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.890
quickly by turning down T. Sure enough,

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.960
we can still find the trajectory over time,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.510
but it's much more jerky.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.050
It is important to realize that although the trajectory that we generate

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.294
using this method or jerk optimal for a given set of boundary conditions,

00:03:53.294 --> 00:03:56.250
they still depend heavily on these conditions.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.050
Therefore, it would be important in the future to wisely pick these end conditions.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.260
Now, I want to show you how I computed what

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.000
the six coefficient had to be in order to satisfy these boundary conditions.
