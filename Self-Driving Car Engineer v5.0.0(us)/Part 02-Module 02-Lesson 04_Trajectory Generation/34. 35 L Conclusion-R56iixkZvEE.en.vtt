00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.530
In this lesson, you saw several approaches to the trajectory generation problem.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.935
None of them is the best for every situation that a self-driving car will encounter.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:13.980
In reality, most self-driving cars have

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.795
several trajectory planners they can use depending on the situation.

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:21.280
A car may use hybrid A* in parking lots,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.477
polynomial trajectory generation on low traffic highways,

00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:28.710
and maybe several others for situations like intersections,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.105
high traffic, et cetera.

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:32.580
In the final project,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.420
you'll get to choose how you implement trajectory generation.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.740
But I suspect you'll find

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.180
that polynomial trajectory generation is well-suited for this problem.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.000
Good luck, and safe driving.
