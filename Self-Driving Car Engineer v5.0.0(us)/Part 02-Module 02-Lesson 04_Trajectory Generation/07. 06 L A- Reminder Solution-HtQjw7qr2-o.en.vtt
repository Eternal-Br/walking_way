00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
And the answer to the first question is No.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.090
The first step before running A* is defining

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.950
a discrete set of states that represent the world we want to plan in.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.115
Before we say A* is a discrete method.

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:15.855
For the second question, the answer is yes.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:17.090
In order to be a valid,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.110
A* heuristic have to be optimistic.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.680
Meaning that they should underestimate the actual cost to go from the cell to the goal.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.210
A* does always find the solution if one exists.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.895
Which as you recall meaning that A* is a complete planning algorithm.

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:37.560
So, the next assertion is somewhat tricky

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.225
because it depends on the search space that is being used and what it represents.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:47.870
If the search space represent only the position x,y like you saw in the previous examples,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.635
and we're trying to move a car,

00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:55.410
there is no guarantees that the sequence of position returned by A* will be drivable.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.300
Therefore, the answer to this question is no.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.045
However, remember that A* is the graph search algorithm.

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:06.990
We can define a more complex search space including heading

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.860
for example and restrict connections between cells such

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.005
that when we close a cell we add to the up and set only cells

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:19.965
such that the transition from the closing cell to the new cells are drivable.

00:01:19.965 --> 00:01:24.460
If we do that the resulting path will be drivable as well.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.730
This corresponds to running A* on a lattice.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.895
Now the last question.

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:33.720
It is true that the solution A* finds are always

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.365
optimal with respect to the discretization of the environment that was used as an input.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.385
The more granular the discretization,

00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:43.090
the better the solution.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.000
We call this resolution optimal.
