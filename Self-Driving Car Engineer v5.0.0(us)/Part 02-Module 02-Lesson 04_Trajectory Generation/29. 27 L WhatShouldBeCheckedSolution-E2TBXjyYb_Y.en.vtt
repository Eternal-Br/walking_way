00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.445
And the answer is all of these qualities should be checked.

00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:11.120
Clearly, a car can only go so fast and speeds above the vehicle maximum are not feasible.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:16.184
But remember that minimum velocity corresponds to going backwards, and that matters, too.

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:19.224
On a lot of roads, it's illegal to go backwards.

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:25.080
For maximum acceleration, we need to consider both lateral and longitudinal acceleration.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.599
Maximum lateral accelerations need to be checked to avoid rollover or skidding.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.338
And maximum longitudinal acceleration depends on your vehicle's powertrain.

00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:39.179
Minimum accelerations would be negative

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.234
and correspond to the vehicle maximum braking force.

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:46.170
Also, your car can only turn so much,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.440
and steering angle should be checked as
