00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.639
In the previous video,

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.990
I showed you that the position of a jerk

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.425
minimizing trajectory is given by a quintic polynomial.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:11.669
In this video, I'm going to present a quick and non-rigorous

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.945
walk through of how we find the six coefficients that describe these polynomial.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.120
It is not essential that you remember the details of this,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.100
but you might find it interesting.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.820
First, we differentiate the equations of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.135
the position in order to get the equations for the velocity,

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:32.195
and then we differentiate it again in order to get the equation for the acceleration.

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:37.054
Now, we could just plug in our six boundary conditions to get the six equations.

00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:41.979
But first we're going to do something that will make our life a little bit easier.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:47.339
We're going to set the initial time as zero and when we do that, we find this.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.790
Which means that three or four unknowns don't need to be identified anymore,

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.905
which reduces the program from six unknowns to three.

00:00:55.905 --> 00:01:01.640
It simplifies those three trajectories by removing three of the unknowns here.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.489
We can gather the known terms into functions of

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.954
the star boundary conditions to make it look like a bit cleaner.

00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:14.840
The C1, C2, and C3 terms are functions of the initial conditions.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.490
What remains is that we only have to identify three parameters,

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:23.144
that depends only on our N boundary condition.

00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:25.494
Those equations look like this,

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:27.535
and we know the final position,

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:33.965
velocity and acceleration at time tf since those are all the quantities that we beat.

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:35.390
Since we know them,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.959
a more useful way to think of these equations is like this,

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.640
where I have deliberately separated

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.260
the known quantities from the unknown variables that we wish to determine.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.594
This is starting to look like a very solvable system of three equations.

00:01:49.594 --> 00:01:53.299
The best way to solve this is with a matrix that looks like this,

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.494
and this problem can be solved by inverting this matrix

00:01:56.495 --> 00:02:00.280
using any matrix mathematical library, which we will do later.
