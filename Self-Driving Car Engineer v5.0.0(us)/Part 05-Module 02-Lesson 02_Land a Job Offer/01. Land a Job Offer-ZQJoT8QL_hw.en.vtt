You've done a lot of preparation for
a job and review by now.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.910
You know what to expect and

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.628
have strategies to help prepare for
whichever questions come your way.

00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:11.750
Remember that what works for someone
else may not be what works for you.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.300
And that's okay, it is you going
into the interview room that day, so

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.600
you get to decide how
you want to prepare.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.900
Our advice is to practice a little
every day for interviewing,

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:24.489
such as thinking over a potential
question or researching the company.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.929
If you come across a topic you
don't feel comfortable with,

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.609
continue practicing until
you get comfortable.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.339
The career resource center has a lot
of tips and resources for you.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.100
The day of the interview,
walk in calm and confident.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.100
Remember, you're already one of the most
qualified candidates for the role.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.770
You'll ace the interview.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.959
