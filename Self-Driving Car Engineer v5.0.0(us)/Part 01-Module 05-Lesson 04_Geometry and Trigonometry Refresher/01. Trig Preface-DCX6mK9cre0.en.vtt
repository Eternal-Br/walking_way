00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.724
Hello. This lesson actually comes from the intro to self-driving cars Nanodegree program.

00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:10.529
We're including it here as completely optional in case you'd

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:14.549
like a quick refresher on basic geometry and trigonometry.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.995
Many aspects of self-driving cars depend heavily on geometric in trigonometric reasoning.

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:24.745
You probably first learned about these topics along time ago,

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:26.830
and maybe you still remember them.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.459
In that case, feel free to skip past this lesson.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.130
However, if you'd like to review concepts like properties of

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.340
right triangles and sines and cosines, then forge ahead.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.560
It might be interesting to see familiar subjects in a new context.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.560
We hope you find this helpful.
