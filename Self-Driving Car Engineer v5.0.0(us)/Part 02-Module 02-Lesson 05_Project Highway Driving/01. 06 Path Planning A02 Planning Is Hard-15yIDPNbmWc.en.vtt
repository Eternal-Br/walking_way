00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.464
So, next project is going to be driving a car on a highway.

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:05.099
We do path planning on a highway.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:06.274
Highway is simplified.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:09.100
It is not as crazy as some intersections could be,

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.379
but you can learn a lot of stuff on highways alone.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.830
There are some baffling issues,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.410
you have to worry about vehicle speed,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.859
not colliding with other cars,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.039
and things like lane changes, and so on.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.424
So, it's going to be fun to do your very first,

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:23.839
nice real-world path-finding project.
