00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.684
In order to run the simulator

00:00:01.683 --> 00:00:04.019
in autonomous mode on my local machine,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.530
I'm going to first clone the GitHub repo for the project.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.470
This repo provides the drive.py file

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.510
that will load my saved model and use it

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.189
to make steering predictions.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.609
Now, I'll copy the saved model from the AWS instance

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.079
to my local machine, then I'll run drive.py and pass my model

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.859
file as an argument.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.759
drive.py is running now, waiting for the simulator

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.500
to start in autonomous mode.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.390
When I launch the simulator this time,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.259
I'll select autonomous mode.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.570
I can see from the output in the terminal that drive.py

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.530
is successfully predicting steering measurements based

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.899
on my model, which is great.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.269
I can also see that my car is driving terribly,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.507
which is not so great.

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:45.089
It's not going very fast, because it's

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.100
spending so much time swerving from side to side.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.859
This is actually a pretty good start.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.200
The network doesn't drive well, but I didn't really

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.400
expect it to.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.109
What I really wanted was to verify

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.700
that I could train a model, save that model,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.080
and then use that model to drive the vehicle in the simulator.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.819
All of that works, so now I just have to improve the model.
