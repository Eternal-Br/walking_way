00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.889
This is the simulator.

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.410
From the home screen, you can launch the simulator

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.480
into either training mode or autonomous mode.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.470
You can also select which track you want to work with.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.330
For the behavioral cloning project,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.519
you only need to work with this first track.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.100
But if you want to give yourself an extra challenge,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.220
you can also train your vehicle to drive on the second track.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.289
Before diving into training though,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.839
let's take a look at the controls.

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.539
In training mode, there are actually three different ways

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.829
to steer the vehicle.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.484
You can steer with the A, W, S, and D

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:34.479
keys, which you might be familiar with if you

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:35.619
play video games.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:39.789
Or you can steer with the arrow keys up, down, left, and right.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.829
Or you can steer with the mouse.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.659
Steering with the mouse actually outputs

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.329
the best steering measurements and the training data.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.159
But I usually steer with the arrow keys.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.199
Because I find that to be the easiest.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.929
You can also press the R key on your keyboard

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.090
to turn recording mode on and off.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.780
Let's go collect some training data.
