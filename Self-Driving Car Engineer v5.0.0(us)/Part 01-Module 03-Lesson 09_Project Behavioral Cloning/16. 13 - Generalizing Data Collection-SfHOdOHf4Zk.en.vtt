00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.629
I could also try to be more clever about data collection.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.429
For example, I could drive around the track

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:07.283
in the opposite direction.

00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:08.699
Training in the opposite direction

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.579
is kind of like gathering data from a whole new track,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.609
and this data will help my model generalize better.

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.500
So when I run in autonomous mode,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.942
if the vehicle gets into a weird place on the road,

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:20.399
the model will have a better chance

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:22.109
of making a good decision.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.390
In the same vein, I could gather training data

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.940
from multiple tracks and mix them together.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.250
This could produce a much more generalized model

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.600
that can drive either track successfully.
