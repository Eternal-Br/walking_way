00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
You're about to enter what's often considered

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.269
the most fun part of the entire nanodegree program.

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:08.773
Which is, you're going to learn about behavioral cloning.

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:11.934
But more importantly, you're going to play with simulation.

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:15.525
You're going to drive a car through simulating yourself,

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:18.339
and then you make a neural network copy you.

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:19.995
So, you'd be superfluous.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:21.644
The neural network will watch you,

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:23.100
will watch your behavior.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.705
The task for the neural network is to pick up your driving skill,

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:29.044
and copy it and do the same.

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:30.390
There's two ways to fail.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.105
One is you know a network fails,

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:35.939
and second is that you use a lousy driver then find somebody else to drive for you.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.554
But if you succeed,

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:38.899
you can take your brain,

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.799
you're driving smarts and input it into a new network that is super cool. So, have fun.
