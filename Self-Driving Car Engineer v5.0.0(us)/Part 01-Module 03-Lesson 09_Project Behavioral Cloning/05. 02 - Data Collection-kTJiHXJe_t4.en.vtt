00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:01.619
Now I'm in training mode

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.679
you can tell because there's this red record button up here.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:07.410
When I click the red record button for the first time,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.300
or I can just press the R key, I'll

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.179
have to select where I want to save my training data.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.160
In this case, I've created an empty folder

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.170
on my desktop called data.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.790
I'll save my training data there.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.939
For now, I'm just going to drive one lap around the track.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.859
Some of the interesting features of the track

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.710
will also present challenges for training an end-to-end driving

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.220
model.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.410
For example, the model will have to learn how

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.600
to handle these sharp turns.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.510
This bridge has a different texture and different borders

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:35.280
than the other parts of the road.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.350
The dirt border on the edge of the track

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.270
here is different than the curbs that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.860
lined the rest of the track.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.079
That could be tricky for the model to learn.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.390
This sequence of sharp turns is challenging

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.460
to drive even by hand.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.950
The neural network could easily lose control here and drive

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.390
the car into the water.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.149
Once we've gotten past this second dirt border,

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.250
we've completed about one lap of driving.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.719
So I'll end the recording.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, I'll see the simulator replay the drive

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479
and save the camera images.
