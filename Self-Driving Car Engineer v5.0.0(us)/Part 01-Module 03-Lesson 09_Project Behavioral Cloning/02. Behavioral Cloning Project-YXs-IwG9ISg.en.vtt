00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.915
&gt;&gt; You've reached the end of the deep learning module.

00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:04.080
Congratulations!

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.509
&gt;&gt; Boy, you sounded just like Sebastian right there.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.619
&gt;&gt; Thank you. I try to be just like Sebastian.

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:14.234
So, do you feel like a deep learning expert now?

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:16.105
&gt;&gt; Well, I wouldn't necessarily say expert,

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:19.660
but I think I know what tools I've got.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.460
&gt;&gt; Alright, I think you're ready to build the behavioral cloning network.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.425
The team at Udacity has built an awesome simulator for you.

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:32.094
It's going to be your job to drive your car around the track,

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:37.570
collect data and then train a deep neural network to do the driving for you.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.350
So, how would you approach this kind of problem?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.439
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess...I know!

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:46.594
I'd compute the gradient.

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:47.890
Yeah. And then once I got the...

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.865
&gt;&gt; Stop, stop, stop. This is deep learning,

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:51.530
not computer vision deep learning.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.868
&gt;&gt; No gradient?

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:53.590
&gt;&gt; No. Focus, deep learning.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.180
&gt;&gt; Got it. Okay. Then, I think I'd go fire up my simulator.

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.149
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.679
When you're done,

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.849
you're going to have an awesome portfolio project to show off.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:09.179
Actually that was kind of cool.
