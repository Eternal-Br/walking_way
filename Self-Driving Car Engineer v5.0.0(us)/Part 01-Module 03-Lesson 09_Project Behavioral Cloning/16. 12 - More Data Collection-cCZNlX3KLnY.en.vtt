00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.480
One obvious approach to improve the network that I

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.470
haven't tried yet, maybe the obvious approach,

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:07.149
is to gather more data.

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:08.689
I'm going to start small by gathering

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:10.519
a second lap of training data.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.459
Let's see how my model does after training

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.630
with two laps of data.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.650
Whoa, we are getting a little bit closer.
