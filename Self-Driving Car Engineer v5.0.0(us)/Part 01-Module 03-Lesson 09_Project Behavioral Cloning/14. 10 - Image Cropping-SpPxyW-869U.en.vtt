00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.189
I'd like to return to something I saw a while back,

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:05.040
which is that the top pixels of the image

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.919
mostly capture sky and trees and hills

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.589
and other elements that might be more distracting for the model

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:11.939
than helpful.

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.209
It looks like this is about 70 rows of pixels.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.690
I also notice that the bottom 25 pixels largely

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.790
consist of the hood of the car.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.549
I'm going to crop out those portions of the images.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.199
Just like with the Lambda layer, I'm

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.719
going to use a built-in Keras layer to perform

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:29.579
the cropping inside of the model.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.739
In this case I'll use the Cropping 2D

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.189
layer to remove the top 70 pixels and the bottom 25

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:36.000
pixels.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.270
Training looks good.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.910
Let's run it.

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:40.409
All right.

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:41.325
That's an improvement.

00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:44.460
The model is driving all the way around the first curve.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.710
It's starting to look like maybe I can get the car all

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740
the way around the track.
