00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.694
Hey, it's me again, your Sebastian,

00:00:02.694 --> 00:00:07.189
and we are now ready for the highlight of the entire nanodegree program,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.030
which is your Capstone Project.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.364
This is a project in which you build the software for the entire self-driving car

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:18.690
end-to-end either in simulation or actually on a physical caveat here in Mountain View.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.630
My recommendation is you obviously can do it on your

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.070
own on simulation and pass this Capstone Project.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.524
But there's an option to do as a team and I would

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:30.119
really highly recommend to do as a team for many reasons.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.140
First reason, in any self-driving car company,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.289
you have to work in teams.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.155
You might as well learn how to work in teams. Second, it's fun.

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:38.579
You get to meet lot of people.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.659
You get to learn from them and we can teach them something new.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.219
Finally, for those who finish the Capstone Project in teams,

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.339
we have this extra benefit,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.675
that we will run your software on a physical, wheel,

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:50.744
car here in Mountain View,

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:54.349
so you can go to any future friend and employer and brag about

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.189
that your software has an actual physical self-driving car.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:00.039
How cool is that?
