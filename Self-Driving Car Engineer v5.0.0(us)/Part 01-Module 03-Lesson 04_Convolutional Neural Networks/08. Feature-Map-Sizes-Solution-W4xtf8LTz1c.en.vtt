00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.960
If you're using the so
called same padding in a stride of 1,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.009
the output width and
height are the same as the input.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.440
We just add zeros to the input
image to make the sizes match.

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:14.119
If you use the so

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.009
called valid padding in a stride of one,
then there is no padding at all.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.400
So if you want to fit your little filter
on the input image without doing and

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.449
padding, you're going to
have to remove one row and

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.239
one column of the image on each side.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.929
So you're left with 26 features in
each of the maps at the output.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.409
If in addition you use a stride of two,

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:41.739
then you only get half as many outputs
So, 13 in width and 13 in height.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.039
In all cases,
the output depth isn't changed.
