One of the very popular ways to

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.019
structure a neural network is called a Convolutional Neural Network.

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:08.399
It was invented by my good friend,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.984
Yann LeCun about 30 years ago,

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:13.919
but it's become incredibly popular for things like image processing,

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.808
and processing large datasets.

00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:19.160
So, let's talk about Convolutional Neural Networks.
