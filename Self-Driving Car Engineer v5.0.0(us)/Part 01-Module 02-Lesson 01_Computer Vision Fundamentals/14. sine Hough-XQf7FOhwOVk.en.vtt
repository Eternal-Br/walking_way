00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
So our strategy to find lines in image space

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:06.755
will be to look for intersecting lines in Hough space.

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:09.765
We do this by dividing up our Hough space into a grid,

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:14.640
and define intersecting lines as all lines passing through a given grid cell.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.410
To do this, I'll first run

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.699
the Canny edge detection algorithm to find all points associated with edges in my image.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.839
I can then consider every point in this edge-detected image as a line in Hough space.

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.375
And where many lines in Hough space intersect,

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:34.570
I declare I have found a collection of points that describe a line in image space.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.200
We have a problem though,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.690
vertical lines have infinite slope in m-b representation,

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.299
so we need a new parameterization.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:46.974
Let's redefine our line in polar coordinates.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:48.554
Now the variable, ρ,

00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:52.575
describes the perpendicular distance of the line from the origin,

00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:56.925
and θ is the angle of the line away from horizontal.

00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:01.714
Now each point in image space corresponds to a sine curve in Hough space.

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:03.585
If we take a whole line of points,

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:06.549
it translates into a whole bunch of sine curves in Hough space.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.674
And again, the intersection of those sine curves

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:13.200
in θ-ρ space gives the parameterization of the line.
