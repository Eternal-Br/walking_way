00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Okay, so now I've taken a greyscaled image,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.500
and using edge detection,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.540
turned it into an image full of dots,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.800
but only the dots that represent edges in the original image.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.535
Now let's connect the dots.

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:15.484
I could connect the dots to look for any kind of shape in my image.

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:17.559
but in this case I'm looking for lines.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.509
To find lines, I need to first adopt a model of a line and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.850
then fit that model to the assortment of dots in my edge detected image.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.304
Keeping in mind that my image is just a function of x and y,

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:33.875
I can use the old familiar equation of a line y = mx + b.

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:37.590
In this case my model includes two parameters, m and b.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.695
In image space, a line is plotted as x versus y,

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:43.304
but in parameter space,

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:45.255
which we will call Hough space,

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:49.215
I can represent that same line as m versus b instead.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:53.670
The Hough transform is just a conversion from image space to Hough space.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.700
So the characterization of a line in image space will be

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.179
a single point at the position m-b in Hough space.
