00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
For starters, let's try finding the lane lines using color.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.915
The lane lines are white,

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:08.849
so how do we select the white pixels in an image?

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.259
To select a color,

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.149
we first need to think about what color actually means in the case of digital images.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.605
In this case, it means that our image is actually made up of a stack of three images,

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.675
one each for red, green and blue.

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:25.545
These images are sometimes called color channels.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:30.282
Each of these color channels contains pixels whose values range from zero to 255,

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:36.164
where zero was the darkest possible value and 255 is the brightest possible value.

00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:39.899
If zero is dark and 255 is bright,

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.259
what color would represent pure white in our combined red,

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:44.509
green and blue image?
