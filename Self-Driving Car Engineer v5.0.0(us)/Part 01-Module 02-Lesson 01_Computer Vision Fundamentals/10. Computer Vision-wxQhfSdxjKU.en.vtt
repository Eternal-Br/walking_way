00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
&gt;&gt; When we talk about computer vision,

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:04.889
we're literally talking about using algorithms

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:07.844
to let a computer see the world like we see it,

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.219
full of depth and color and shapes and meaning.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.701
Computer Vision is a really broad field

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:16.830
and right now we're just going to focus on a few features.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.154
Later in the Nanodegree program,

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.690
we'll be getting much more in depth with the tools and

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.220
techniques used in Computer Vision for self-driving cars.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:27.570
&gt;&gt; At this point, we'll introduce you to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.585
two powerful techniques that you'll use for your first project,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:34.079
where you'll be identifying the lane lines in an image of the road.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.354
The first technique we'll look at,

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:38.000
is Canny Edge Detection. So let's give it a go.
