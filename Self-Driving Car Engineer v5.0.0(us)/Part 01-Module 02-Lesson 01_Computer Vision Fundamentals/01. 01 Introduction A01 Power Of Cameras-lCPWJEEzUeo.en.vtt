Welcome to Computer Vision,

00:00:02.575 --> 00:00:04.665
which is an amazing field.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:10.099
You're going to learn in this unit things like edge extraction and colors spaces,

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.669
stuff that Computer Vision people know in and out.

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.599
The most important thing to remember is,

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.629
it's actually really easy to get started,

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:19.839
and it's really important to have fun.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.440
Making computer see is an amazing skill.
