00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
The name Canny refers to John F. Canny,

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.820
who developed this edge detection algorithm in 1986.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.054
With edge detection, the goal is to identify the boundaries of an object in an image.

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:12.855
So, to do that, first,

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:16.734
I'll convert to grayscale. All right.

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:19.804
And next, I'll compute the gradient.

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:23.054
Nice. Okay. So now,

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:25.335
you're looking at the gradient of my world,

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.300
where the brightness of each pixel

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.699
corresponds to the strength of the gradient at that point.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.085
We're going to find edges by tracing out the pixels that follow the strongest gradients.

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:38.015
All right. But, the gradient world is a little scary.

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:39.920
So, let's go back to color.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.200
By identifying edges, we can more easily detect objects by their shape.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.679
So, what exactly is an edge?

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.750
Let's first get some intuition by having a look at

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.844
the parameters for the OpenCV Canny function. You'll call it like this.

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:56.500
In this case, I'm applying the Canny function to an image

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.905
called gray and the output will be another image called edges.

00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:05.390
Low threshold and high threshold determine how strong the edges must be to be detected.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.260
You can think of the strength of an edge as being defined by how

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.240
different the values are in adjacent pixels in the image;

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.569
really just the strength of the gradient.

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.094
Next, I'll show you how that works,

00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:17.995
so that you have a clear picture of what's going on under the hood

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:22.000
when you use the Canny edge detection method in OpenCV.
