00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
Looking at a greyscale image I see bright points,

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:05.564
dark points and all the gray in between.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:09.080
Rapid changes in brightness are where we find the edges.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.000
Our image is just a mathematical function of x and y so

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.724
we can perform mathematical operations on it just like any other function.

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.804
For example, we can take its derivative

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:21.030
which is just a measure of change of this function.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.650
A small derivative means small change,

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.404
big derivative, big change.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:25.950
Images are two dimensional,

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.600
so it makes sense to take the derivative with respect to x and y simultaneously.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.179
This is called the gradient and in computing it,

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:36.674
we're measuring how fast pixel values are changing at each point

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:40.424
in an image and in which direction they're changing most rapidly.

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:43.094
Computing the gradient gives us thick edges.

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:44.729
With the Canny algorithm,

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.559
we will thin out these edges to find

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.065
just the individual pixels that follow the strongest gradients.

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:53.519
We'll then extend those strong edges to include pixels all the way down

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.000
to a lower threshold that we defined when calling the Canny function.
