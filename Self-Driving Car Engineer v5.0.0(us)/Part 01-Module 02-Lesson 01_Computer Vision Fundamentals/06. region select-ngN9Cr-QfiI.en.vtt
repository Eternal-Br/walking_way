00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.514
Now, let's focus on just the region of the image that interests us,

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:07.344
namely, the region where the lane lines are.

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:10.410
In this case, you can assume that the camera that took

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.150
the image is mounted in a fixed position on the front of the car.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.469
Therefore, the lane lines will always appear in the same general region of the image.
