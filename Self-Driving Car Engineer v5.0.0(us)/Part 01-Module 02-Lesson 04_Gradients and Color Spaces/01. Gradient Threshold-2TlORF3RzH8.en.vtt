00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.040
In the introduction module, you used Canny edge detection

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.730
to find pixels that were likely to be part of a line in an image.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.280
Canny is great at finding all possible lines in an image, but for

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.429
lane detection, this gave us a lot of edges on scenery, and cars, and

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.108
other objects that we ended up discarding.

00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:20.170
Realistically, with lane finding,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.530
we know ahead of time that the lines we are looking for are close to vertical.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.039
So, how can we take advantage of that fact?

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.500
Well, we can use gradients in a smarter way to detect steep

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.829
edges that are more likely to be lanes in the first place.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.839
With Canny, we were actually taking a derivative with respect to X and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.220
Y in the process of finding edges.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.060
But let's stop and have a look at what those individual derivatives look like

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.940
for an image of the road.
