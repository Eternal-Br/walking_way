00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
&gt;&gt; I hope you enjoyed learning about neural networks and convolutions.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.419
So far, you've been learning about deep neural networks at

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.400
the conceptual level and applying

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.984
these techniques to a range of image classification tasks.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:13.695
In the next project,

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.254
you're going to return to autonomous driving.

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:18.195
&gt;&gt; That's right. Next, you're going to build

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.699
a deep neural network to classify traffic signs.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.494
Your network should be able to take an image and decide if it's a stop sign,

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.420
a yield sign, a different type of sign or maybe no sign at all.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.530
&gt;&gt; This will be a terrific portfolio project to demonstrate for

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.000
employers your hands-on practical experience with deep neural networks.
