00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.155
While viewing message definitions and topic information can be informative,

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.769
sometimes the best way to understand what is going on is to look

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.539
at the messages themselves as they are published to a topic.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:11.720
For example, when the turtle rotates left and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.584
right which axis is it actually rotating about?

00:00:14.584 --> 00:00:16.414
And what are the units of rotation?

00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:19.710
And are rotations expressed in terms of radians or degrees?

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.525
To get the answer to these questions,

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:23.385
You can use the command rostopic echo.

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:24.890
Let's dive right into its usage.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.749
Rostopic, echo,

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.079
and then the name of the topic forward

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.759
slash turtle one forward slash command underscore vel.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:36.314
If you've forgotten the name of the topic,

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:37.710
you can easily find it by using

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.340
the command rostopic list which you were introduced to earlier in the screentask.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.445
When you hit enter, the terminal cursor will move to a new line

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:47.659
and it will appear as though nothing has happened. Fear not though.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.795
Rostopic echo is simply waiting for a message to be published on the command vel topic.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:53.760
In order to publish a message to the topic,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.979
we must jump all the way back to the console window for

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.125
the turtle underscore teleop underscore key node.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:03.530
And I'm now going to hit the left arrow key.As expected,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.340
the turtle turned counter-clockwise by some angle for about one second.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.125
I'd estimate that the actual number is somewhat maybe like greater than 90 degrees,

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.689
but perhaps less than 135 degrees.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.819
Let's go back to the rostopic echo terminal and see what happened.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.030
And as you can see we've caught a message.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.340
All of the velocity components are zero with

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.980
the exception of the z component of the angular velocity.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.689
Here we see a value of two.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.405
This tells us, that when the turtle rotates counterclockwise,

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:31.459
it is doing so around the z axis.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:32.719
The magnitude of the velocity,

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.030
tells us that the units associated with the movement are

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.049
probably in radians per second. How did I get there?

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.750
Well, a quick math check will tell us that two radians corresponds to

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.150
approximately 114.6 degrees. And there we have it.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.040
You should now have some understanding about rostopic echo and

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.310
how it can be used for investigating messages passing over a topic.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.074
As a side note, If this unit's investigation seems a little bit contrived,

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.814
that's because it certainly was.

00:01:57.814 --> 00:01:59.359
Like any sensible engineers,

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.129
the developers of Ros have elected to standardize around S-I units wherever applicable.

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.980
Which is to say, length is measured in meters.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.400
Mass is measured in kilograms,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.735
time is measured in seconds and angles are measured in radians and so on.

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:15.889
You've now completed a brief tour of the Ros command line tools.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:16.969
Armed with this knowledge and

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.685
the general understanding of the Ros communications architecture,

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:21.469
you should be prepared to move on to the next

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.139
step - setting up your first catkin workspace.
