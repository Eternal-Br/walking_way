00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
Now that we have an understanding of some of the fundamental concepts of ROS,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.615
we can drive right into the command line where we will create

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.589
cute little turtle robots with a package called Turtlesim.

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.200
Like this?

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.849
Yeah. Just like this.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.649
OK, but hold on a second.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.420
We should probably stop and explain

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.629
what cute little turtles have to do with robotics in the first place.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:27.774
Indeed. Well cuteness aside the use of turtles and robotics goes way back to the 1940s.

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:30.690
That's right. Early roboticist William Gray Walter

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.118
created some of the first autonomous devices,

00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:35.820
turtle robots which he called Elmer and Elsie.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.340
And in the 1960s at MIT,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.384
Seymour Papert used turtle robots in robotics education.

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:44.490
Seymour's robots could perform a few basic functions.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.280
They could move forward or backwards by a given distance,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.320
rotate by a given angle,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.210
or they could drop the retractable pen on

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.640
their bellies allowing them to draw as they moved.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.670
These primitive functions could be triggered simultaneously allowing

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.484
the robots to move along complex trajectories and make sophisticated drawings.

00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:05.275
This connection between robots and turtles continues to this very day.

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.200
And in your first exercise with ROS,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.000
you'll be launching your own turtle robot and simulation.
