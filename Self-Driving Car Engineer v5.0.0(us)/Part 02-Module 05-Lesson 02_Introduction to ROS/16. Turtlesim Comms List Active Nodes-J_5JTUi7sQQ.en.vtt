00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.525
Now that you know how to start the ROS master and are able to run nodes,

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:07.269
you can begin to investigate the topics and messages

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.359
associated with the turtlesim node and the turtle teleop key nodes.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:14.095
We'll be picking up this discussion from where we left off in the last screencast,

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:15.210
which is to say roscore,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.434
turtlesim node, and the turtle teleop key nodes are all running.

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:21.625
Let's investigate exactly what's going on behind the scenes.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:23.710
If you had just stumbled upon this running system,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.245
you might be inclined to ask the question, which nodes are running?

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:31.149
To answer this you would open a new terminal and use the command rosnode list.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.700
This command will query the ROS master for a list of all of

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.850
the active nodes on the system and print them to the console.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.490
And there we have it, a list of three nodes running on the system.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.969
Two of these nodes should look relatively familiar as we

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.954
launched them explicitly just a moment ago. But what's the third?

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:49.395
ROSout is a node that's automatically launched by the ROS master.

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:50.905
It's responsible for aggregating,

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:54.250
filtering, and recording log messages to a text file.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.859
We'll learn more about that one later in upcoming projects where we will

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.000
be getting hands on experience with ROS log messages.
