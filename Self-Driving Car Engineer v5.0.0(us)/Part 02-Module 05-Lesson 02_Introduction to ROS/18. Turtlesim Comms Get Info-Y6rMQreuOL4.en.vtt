00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.339
In the example here,

00:00:02.338 --> 00:00:03.944
even though you have a list of topics,

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:06.355
some things are still relatively unclear.

00:00:06.355 --> 00:00:09.509
For example, the ROS topic list command does not tell us which nodes are

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.039
publishing or subscribing to a topic or what type of messages are being passed around.

00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:16.050
To get the information I just mentioned,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.245
you will use the command rostopicinfo.

00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:21.114
Let's start with getting information about the command vel topic.

00:00:21.114 --> 00:00:26.149
Rostopic info, and then the name of the topic you'd like more information about.

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.629
In this case forward slash turtle1,

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.519
forward slash command underscore vel.

00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:34.070
And there you have it. The command vel topic has one publisher,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.380
the teleup node, and one subscriber the turtlesim node.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.978
This is actually as you might have suspected a while back when we were

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:43.057
using the keyboard to command the turtle via the teleop node.

00:00:43.057 --> 00:00:45.530
The message type associated with the command vel topic is

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
a twist message and it's part of the geometry messages package.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.228
You might be asking yourself right now,

00:00:50.228 --> 00:00:51.918
well, what is a twist message?

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:55.000
To learn more you'll use the ROS message command.
