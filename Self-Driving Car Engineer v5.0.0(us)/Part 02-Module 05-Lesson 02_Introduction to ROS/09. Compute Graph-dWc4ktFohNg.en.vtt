00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.039
These diagrams of nodes and topics and how they're all

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:12.154
connected and are frequently referred to as compute graphs.

00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:16.433
Visualizing the compute graph is very useful for understanding what nodes exist,

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.964
and how they communicate with one another.

00:00:18.963 --> 00:00:22.869
ROS provides a tool called rqt_graph for showing the compute graph of a system.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.489
A moderately complex robot will likely have dozens of nodes,

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.684
even more topics and quite a few services.

00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:35.939
This is EMBot, a mobile-based demonstration platform developed by electric movement.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.005
As far as robotics platforms go,

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.478
this one is relatively simple,

00:00:39.478 --> 00:00:41.783
primarily consisting of a lidar unit,

00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:46.548
a depth camera and four independently driven omni-directional wheels.

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:49.390
And here's EMBot's compute graph.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.359
It becomes clear pretty quickly why rqt_graph is a handy tool to have around.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.755
It allows you to zoom in and pan around the graph,

00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:00.289
as well as choose exactly what information is displayed.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.289
Now that you've been introduced to some of

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.334
the fundamental components of ROS' communication architecture,

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:07.450
it's time to get some hands-on experience

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.000
with a helpful little simulator called TurtleSim.
