00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.165
One of the beautiful things that exist in this space is

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:05.759
a operating system for robots that we're going to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.539
use extensively in the upcoming Capstone Project.

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.344
It's called ROS, R-O-S.

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:14.640
So, we want to show you ROS because it solves

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.789
some of the hard problems about modularity and

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.730
interprocess communication that you otherwise have to do by

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.039
hand and we want you to use ROS later on in your Capstone Project.
