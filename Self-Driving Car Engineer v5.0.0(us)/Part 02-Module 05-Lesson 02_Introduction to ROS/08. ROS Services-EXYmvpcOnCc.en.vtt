00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
Passing messages over topics between publishers and subscribers is

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.529
useful but it's not a one size fits all communications solution.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.470
There are times when a request response pattern is useful.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.230
For these types of interactions,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.009
ROS provides what are called services.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.975
Like topics, services allow the passing of messages between nodes.

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.885
However, unlike topics, a service is not a bus

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:25.679
and there are no publishers or subscribers associated with them.

00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:28.648
Instead, nodes interacting via services do so on

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.728
a one to one basis using a request and response messages.

00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:36.820
Let's take a look at how a service might be used in the example we've been developing.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.849
Let's say that the behavior executor node wants to capture an image from the camera.

00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:44.718
We could just have it subscribe to the camera images topic.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.460
It would then receive a new image each time the camera node publishes one.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.600
However, this might be undesirable if

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.920
the executor only wants to capture an image every once in a while.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.789
Instead of subscribing to the camera images topic here,

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.950
we'll define a new service for the camera node.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.295
Let's call it capture image.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:05.790
The request message definition might be a custom message type

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.810
called exposure time and the response might just be an image message.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.947
By issuing a service call to the capture image service,

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:16.025
the behavior executor node or any other node for that matter,

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:20.518
is able to request the camera should capture an image with a given exposure time setting.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:22.950
The camera node will then respond to the request

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.168
by sending a message containing the resulting image.
