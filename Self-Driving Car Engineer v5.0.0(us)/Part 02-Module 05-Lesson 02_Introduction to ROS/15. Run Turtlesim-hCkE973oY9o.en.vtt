00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Now that you've got your ROS environment variables in place,

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:04.870
you're ready to run some turtlesim nodes.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.759
So let's jump right into this.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.140
The first thing you're going to need to do is start the ROS master process.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.000
To do this, all you need to do is run the command roscore.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.300
And there we go.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.429
We've been hit with a wall of text ending with the line 'started core service'.

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:22.320
You don't need to worry about all the detail printed on

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.100
the console as none of it is really relevant to us right now.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.239
As long as you don't see any colorful red text

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.289
disclaiming that there is an error, you're good to go.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.564
Now that the master process is running,

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.075
you'll be able to run nodes.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:37.334
The first node that you're going to run is the turtlesim node itself.

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:43.204
To run the node, you'll want to open a new terminal and execute the rosrun command.

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:46.567
The first parameter you'll be passing to the rosrun command is turtlesim,

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:50.122
the name of the ROS package containing the turtlesim nodes,

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:52.798
and turtlesim_node which is the name of

00:00:52.798 --> 00:00:56.814
the node executable residing in the package that you wish to run.

00:00:56.814 --> 00:00:59.759
And there you have it, you're running the simulator and

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.579
you've got a little turtle waiting to be commanded around the window.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.855
To command the turtle to move,

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:06.284
you must run another node,

00:01:06.284 --> 00:01:08.084
the turtle teleop node.

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:11.487
Once again, you'll need to open another terminal window.

00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:14.280
And you'll run the same command you ran a moment ago

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.400
with the exception of the node executable name; rosrun turtlesim, our package name,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:27.974
and turtle_teleop_key, the name of the node executable you wish to run.

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:30.599
If you ever forget the name of the package or node that you

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.560
wish to run tab completion can be helpful.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.129
So, let me go ahead and backspace.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:38.700
Let's say I don't know the node name,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.724
but I know that it starts with turtle,

00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:42.629
and then I hit tab tab.

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:45.239
I see that the turtlesim package has

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:48.519
two nodes that start with the word turtle: There's turtlesim_node,

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:50.659
the node that we just ran,

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.349
and then there's turtle teleop key,

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.040
the node that we're trying to run.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.645
So rosrun turtlesim, turtle teleop key.

00:02:00.644 --> 00:02:02.539
Now the turtlesim teleop node is running.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.682
With the turtle teleop console selected,

00:02:06.682 --> 00:02:09.866
you can use the arrow keys to drive the turtle around the virtual world.

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:13.453
Let's give this a try.

00:02:13.454 --> 00:02:15.900
Yep. And there we go.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.060
We're now ready to begin investigating the turtlesim coms.
