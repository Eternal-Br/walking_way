00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome to ROS Essentials.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.165
I'm here with Thomas and Brandon,

00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:07.014
who will be your guides through the next few lessons.

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:09.570
So Brandon, what are these lessons all about?

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.484
These lessons are all about the Robot Operating System or ROS for short.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:17.893
ROS is widely used across the industry and academia for building robotics applications.

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:21.148
After this quick introduction to the basic components of ROS,

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:24.719
you'll have the tools you need to start building awesome robots yourself.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.510
Fantastic. So Thomas, how does the content in

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.184
these lessons relate to what students will be doing through the rest of the program?

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:33.539
We'll be using ROS throughout this program as

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.448
our software framework to control super cool robots.

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:37.769
In the lessons that come,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.969
you'll take what you've learned here and build on it to create some exciting projects.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.109
Awesome. Well, let's get started then.
