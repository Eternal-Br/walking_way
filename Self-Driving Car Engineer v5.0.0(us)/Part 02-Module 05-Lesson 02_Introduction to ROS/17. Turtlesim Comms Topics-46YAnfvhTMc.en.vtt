00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.899
In addition to getting a list of all active nodes,

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.195
you will often desire a list of all topics.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:09.804
You can obtain the list of topics by using the command rostopic list.

00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:11.804
This will give you a list of all the topics.

00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:14.220
We can see that there are some topics associated with

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.570
the ROS out node that we discussed a moment ago,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.390
and there are some topics grouped together under the turtle1 named space.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.940
As you may have guessed, all of the topics grouped under the turtle1 named space are

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.589
provided by the turtlesim node and are

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:28.613
associated with the turtle that we see in the virtual world.

00:00:28.614 --> 00:00:30.839
Publishing a message to the command vel topic

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:33.719
will command the turtle to move with the given velocity.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.030
Turtle 1 also contains a color sensor and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.064
the turtlesim node publishes readings from the sensor on the color sensor topic.

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:42.118
Lastly the turtlesim node publishes

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:45.134
the position and orientation of the turtle to the post topic.

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:47.158
While the topic names here are somewhat indicative

00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:49.695
of their purpose this won't always be the case.

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:53.000
Sometimes you will need to get more information about a specific topic
