00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.923
Development of ROS began in the mid-2000s as

00:00:02.923 --> 00:00:06.479
Project Switchyard in Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:11.054
In 2007, ROS became a formal entity with support from Willow Garage.

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:16.410
Since 2013, the Open Source Robotics Foundation has been maintaining and developing ROS.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.530
One of the primary motivations for developing ROS was

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.759
the recognition that researchers were constantly reinventing the wheel.

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.559
There weren't many reusable robotics software components

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.254
that could be used as a starting point for a project.

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:32.219
In addition, because different groups were all working on custom solutions,

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.899
it was difficult for them to share code and ideas.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.520
It was also difficult to compare results.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.895
ROS aims to facilitate the development process by eliminating these problems.

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:43.479
So who uses ROS?

00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:45.570
Lots of people and lots of companies.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.450
There are drones, kinematic arms, wheeled robots,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.560
and even bipedal robots out there using ROS, every day.
