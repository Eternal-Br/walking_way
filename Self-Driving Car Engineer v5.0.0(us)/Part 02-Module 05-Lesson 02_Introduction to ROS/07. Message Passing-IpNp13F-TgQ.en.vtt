00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.445
Now that we've discussed topics,

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.080
let's talk about the messages transmitted over them.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.009
Each ROS distribution comes with a wide variety of

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.335
predefined message types which are available for your use.

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:19.920
There are message types for communicating physical quantities,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.644
such as positions, velocities,

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:25.049
accelerations, rotations, and durations.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.510
There are also messages for communicating sensor readings,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.399
such as laser scans, images,

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.590
point clouds, inertial measurements, and more.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.905
The number of message types available in a full ROS install is actually quite staggering.

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:38.655
Doing a simple search in my system,

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:42.079
I was able to count over 200 different message types.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.344
However, even with so many useful message types available,

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.850
there will still be times when you want to define your own.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
We'll tackle that later on in this lesson.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.350
It's important to note that although

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.560
the named messages would seem to imply text based contents,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.450
they can in fact contain any kind of data.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.174
Here's an example of the message types associated with the topics we looked at earlier.

00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:06.644
In this case, the topic called camera images is transporting

00:01:06.644 --> 00:01:10.665
image messages from the camera node to the position estimator node.

00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:14.040
The wheel encoder's topic is transporting rotation messages from

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.000
the wheel encoder node to the position estimator node and so on.
