00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
In the previous lesson you gained a conceptual understanding of

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:07.769
the system architecture for Carla, our autonomous vehicle.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.959
Next you're going to see how this software is

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.955
implemented and even practice implementing some of the software yourself.

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:18.870
Carla's software uses the Robot Operating System or ROS for short.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.530
ROS is an Open Source Robotics framework that provides libraries and

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.320
tools for working with hardware and for passing messages between components.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.734
ROS provides scaffolding to integrate the components of the car.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:33.810
In the next lessons our Udacity colleagues from

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.900
the robotics Nano-degree program will teach you the basics

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.000
of ROS so you'll be ready to write code that can drive Carla.
