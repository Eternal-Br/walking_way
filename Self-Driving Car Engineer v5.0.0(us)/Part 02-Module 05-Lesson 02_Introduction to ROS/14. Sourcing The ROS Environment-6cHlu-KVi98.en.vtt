00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
In order to launch the turtlesim package,

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.269
you must first ensure that all of the ROS environment variables have been correctly set.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.105
Each ROS distribution provides a handy little script called setup.bash,

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:12.394
specifically for this purpose.

00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:15.509
The script is hidden away in the Opt ROS kinetic directory and you

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.350
can run it with the bash command source.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.149
Among other things,

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.070
the environment variables tell our bash shell

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.265
where ROS commands and packages can be found.

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:27.838
One simple way to determine if the environment variables have been

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:31.003
set is to use the bash tab completion feature,

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.329
typing ROS followed by double tapping

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.719
the tab key gives us an extensive list of all commands beginning

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.100
with the characters R-O-S. And there we go, there's our list.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.939
This list would be much shorter had we not sourced as ROSsetup.bash.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:52.239
Later on in this module we'll become more familiar with some of the commands listed here.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.618
Having to source the ROSsetup.bash script for

00:00:54.618 --> 00:00:57.673
each new terminal you open is quickly going to become painful.

00:00:57.673 --> 00:01:03.310
To combat the monotony we can add the command to sourceSetup.bash to our bash RC file.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.930
Bash RC, is simply a shell script that is

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.055
automatically run whenever you start a bash session.

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:12.420
Now, when we open a new terminal and type ROS tab tab,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.245
we'll see the long list of ROS core commands.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.750
There we go, there is our list.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.780
And that's it for setting up your environment.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.000
You're now ready to run the turtlesim.
