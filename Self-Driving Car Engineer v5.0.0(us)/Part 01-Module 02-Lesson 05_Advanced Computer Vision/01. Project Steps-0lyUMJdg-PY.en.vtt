00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:01.652
&gt;&gt; Great job so far.

00:00:01.653 --> 00:00:05.484
You now have all the tools you need to build the first stage of the project.

00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:07.721
To get you started in the right direction,

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:11.884
we're going to show you step-by-step how to use these tools to map out the lane

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:13.143
on an image of the road.

00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:15.546
&gt;&gt; Let's review what steps you'll take.

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:18.326
First, you need to calibrate the camera.

00:00:18.326 --> 00:00:21.314
Second, correct for image distortion.

00:00:21.314 --> 00:00:24.707
Third, implement a color and gradient threshold.

00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:28.619
And fourth, warp the image using perspective transform.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.679
Is that it?

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.759
&gt;&gt; Well, that gets us most of the way but

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.450
we still need to decide which pixels are lane line pixels.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.230
And then determine the line shape and position.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:40.759
So next we're going to go through an example of that so

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:43.039
you have a clear picture of how to approach the project.
