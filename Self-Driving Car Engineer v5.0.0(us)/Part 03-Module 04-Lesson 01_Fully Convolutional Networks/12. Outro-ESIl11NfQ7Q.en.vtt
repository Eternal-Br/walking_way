00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
Congratulations. You've learned about SDNs.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.125
You learn how these network built upon one by one convolutions,

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:11.820
skip connections and up sampling through the use of transposed convolutions.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.849
In the next lesson,

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.259
we'll use fully convolutional networks to

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.380
tackle scene understanding and semantic segmentation.
