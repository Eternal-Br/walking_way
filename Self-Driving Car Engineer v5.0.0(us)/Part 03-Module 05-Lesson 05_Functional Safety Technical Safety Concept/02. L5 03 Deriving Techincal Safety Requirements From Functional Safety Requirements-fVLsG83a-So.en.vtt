00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Technical safety requirements describe what a system

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.929
will do when a malfunction violates a safety goal.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:11.199
Let's derive an example from the lane departure warning safety goal.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.820
Recall from the safety goal,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.010
we derived a functional safety requirement that

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.920
the electronic power steering ECU needed to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.850
keep the torque amplitude below a maximum threshold.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.179
Now, we will go one step further and derive a technical safety requirement.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.549
When the lane departure warning safety software component sends a torque request,

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:39.384
the request amplitude should be below the maximum allowed threshold.

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:41.759
Using the system architecture diagram,

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:44.129
the requirement is formally that

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.050
the LDW safety component shall ensure that the amplitude of

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.869
the LDW torque request sent to

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:58.070
the final electronic power steering torque component is below max torque amplitude.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.570
We'll start using acronyms to make the requirements easier to read.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.280
LDW is lane departure warning.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.015
While EPS is electronic power steering.

00:01:10.015 --> 00:01:11.775
Notice the difference between

00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:15.865
a functional safety requirement and the technical safety requirement.

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:17.849
The functional safety requirement gives

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:22.044
a general idea of what a system is supposed to do.

00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:25.859
The technical safety requirement indicates the signal flow

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.000
and describes which components are in charge of the functionality.
