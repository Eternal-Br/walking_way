00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Not all Technical Safety Requirements are

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.415
derived directly from Software Safety Requirements.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:08.129
There are actually five other categories of

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.464
Technical Safety Requirements that ISO 26262 requires.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:15.839
Two of the categories are for detecting false either within

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.070
the system or in an external device interacting with the system.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.870
The other three categories are from

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.115
measures that enable the system to reach a safe state,

00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:28.229
to implement a warning and degradation concept,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.135
or to prevent latent faults.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:34.935
Here is an example of each case for the lane departure warning function.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.890
A fault within a system could either be

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.609
a software error or a hardware component that malfunctions.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.019
A general technical safety requirement would be that the validity and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.035
integrity of the data transmission for the LDW_Torque_Request signal shall be ensured.

00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:54.989
We will talk about specific methods for checking

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.770
data validity and integrity in the text below the video.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.255
Now, let's look at a fault that is external to the Lane Assistance Item.

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:07.399
Let's say hypothetically, an external anti-lock brake

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.674
ECU was transmitting speed information to the Lane Keeping Assistance Item.

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:15.480
An error in the communication line between

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.685
the brake ECU and the power steering ECU could cause a failure.

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:22.049
Code needs to be added that checks for

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.579
communication errors and the information gets transmitted between ECUs.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.745
We will derive a technical safety requirement that

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:33.450
enables the system to reach and maintain a safe state.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.590
We already derived the safe state in the functional safety concept.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
The Lane Assistance System shall be switched off.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.740
A technical safety requirement would be that,

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:48.129
as soon as a failure is detected by the LDW function,

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:54.420
it shall deactivate the LDW feature and the LDW_Torque_Request shall be set to zero.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.400
The next category involves

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.165
Technical Safety Requirements for implementing warning and degradation concepts.

00:02:01.165 --> 00:02:04.650
We have already said in the previous lesson that a warning light

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.689
will turn on if the Lane Assistance Item malfunctions.

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.004
A technical safety requirement would be that,

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:15.945
as soon as the LDW function deactivates the LDW feature,

00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:19.710
the LDW safety software block shall send

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.435
a signal to the car display ECU to turn on a warning light.

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:30.120
And finally, let's discuss an example of measure that prevents latent faults.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.800
Latent faults are errors that exist but can not be detected.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.245
An example would be a software error in the code that actually checks for the failures.

00:02:40.245 --> 00:02:45.015
Measures against latent faults generally take place during power up,

00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:47.464
power down, or during maintenance.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:51.914
A Technical Safety Requirement for the Lane Keeping Assistance would be;

00:02:51.914 --> 00:02:55.419
memory test shall be conducted at the start up

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:59.394
of EPS ECU to check for any faults in memory.

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:05.195
The functional safety standard only requires avoiding latent faults for items labeled

00:03:05.194 --> 00:03:11.734
ASIL C or D. Now that we have described different types of Technical Safety Requirements,

00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:15.915
we are going to discuss adding attributes to these requirements.

00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:20.549
Attributes include ASIL, Fault Tolerant Time Intervals,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.020
and a description of Safe State Transition.
