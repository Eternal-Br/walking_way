00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Like in the functional safety concept,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.255
we will now allocate technical safety requirements to the system architecture.

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:09.929
The first three technical safety requirements we

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.785
identified will be allocated to the LDW safety software component.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:19.644
Let's summarize what these three safety requirements are doing.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:23.144
The LDW safety software element receives

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:29.006
the vibrational torque request from the basic lane keeping functionality block.

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:32.789
The LDW safety element checks to make sure that

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.454
the torque request is below the maximum amplitude and frequency.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:41.259
If the maximum amplitude or frequency is crossed,

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:48.472
the LDW safety element deactivates the functionality and sets the torque request to zero.

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:51.060
The LDW safety block then sends

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.204
its stock request to the final EPS torque generator block.

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:59.229
A warning light needs to alert the driver to the malfunction.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.271
The LDW safety block will send a status signal out to the car display.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:06.885
The signal indicates whether or not

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:11.094
the lane assistance item is active and functioning properly.

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:15.984
The status signal would also go to the final EPS torque generator block.

00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:19.439
This block could use the status signal as

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.280
an extra check on sending an invalid signal to the motor.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.629
To check the validity and integrity of the torque request,

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:31.759
a softer block would be added specifically for this task between

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.680
the LDW safety block and the final EPS torque generator block.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.188
This block is ensuring that the signal has not been corrupted during the transmission.

00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:44.236
For the memory test requirement,

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:47.704
there is a separate external block with the code.

00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:51.399
This block will run when the vehicle is turned on

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.510
because the ECUs throughout the vehicle can't share this block.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.640
The ASIL for the functional blocks are inherited from the technical safety requirements.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.094
You can see that safety relevant blocks are labeled ASIL C,

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:09.974
except for the memory test code,

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:14.829
which we previously explained only needs to be labeled ASIL A.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.665
The basic lane assistance functionality is labeled QM,

00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:23.789
which we discussed in the previous lesson in reference to ASIL decomposition.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:29.219
We have now derived technical safety requirements and allocated them to the architecture.
