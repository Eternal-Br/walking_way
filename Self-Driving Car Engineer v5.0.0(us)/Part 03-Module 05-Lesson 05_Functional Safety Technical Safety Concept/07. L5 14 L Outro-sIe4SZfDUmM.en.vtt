00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.423
We have now the right technical safety requirements

00:00:03.423 --> 00:00:06.519
and allocated these requirements to the system architecture.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.192
Traveling down the V-model from technical safety concept,

00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:13.035
we arrive at hardware and software development.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:18.285
Developing hardware and software follows a similar arc to what we have already done.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.210
We first specify safety requirements.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.450
Next, we design the hardware and software architectures.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.660
In the next lesson, we'll give an introduction to the software

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.000
and hardware development according to the functional safety standard.
