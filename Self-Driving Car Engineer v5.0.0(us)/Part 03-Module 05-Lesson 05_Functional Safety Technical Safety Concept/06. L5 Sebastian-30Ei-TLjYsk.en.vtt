00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Yeah, we always collected lots of data.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.490
And one of the things we did a lot was called regression testing.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.915
At the time, we didn't know what the name was,

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:08.035
but it was very obvious what to do,

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:13.619
which is you collect data and we collect especially data sets if something goes wrong.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.689
And then we fix what's wrong with that data,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.010
we replay that data.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.179
We build our software so every data set could just

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.809
be replayed as if the real car was running with the real processes.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:28.329
And then we hope that the software fix would fix the problem.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.409
But we wouldn't toss the data afterwards, we'd keep it.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.810
And the reason is: we wanted to test,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.370
not just on the most recent data,

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.399
but also on older data.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:38.734
So, we would be able to say,

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:40.760
okay we fixed the problem over here,

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.970
but then the question would be,

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.164
have we maybe accidentally used a new problem?

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:46.993
And very often what happens if we fix the problem over here,

00:00:46.993 --> 00:00:50.225
and then this old data set over here would completely break.

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:52.609
And it was really important to us to understand this.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.659
We almost used the old data as old simulation.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.474
We didn't really use simulation at the time,

00:00:57.475 --> 00:01:00.225
but we wanted this old data around as a test overnight.

00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:02.630
So, we would have to re-drive everything from scratch.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.140
And in doing so we were able to change software carefully with

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.974
minimum exposure to what's working already because we're

00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:13.039
always had the old data around to test of what you already built.
