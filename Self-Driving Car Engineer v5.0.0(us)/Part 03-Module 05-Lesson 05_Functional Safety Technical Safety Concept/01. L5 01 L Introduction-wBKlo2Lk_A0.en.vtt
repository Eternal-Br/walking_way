00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.570
A technical safety concept and a functional safety concept look quite similar.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.490
Again, we will be defining new requirements and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.810
then allocating those requirements to our system architecture.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.310
The difference is that functional safety concept

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.010
considers an item from a bird's eye view.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.857
The technical safety concept is more concrete,

00:00:19.856 --> 00:00:23.204
looking at the safety requirements of sensors,

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:24.989
control unit, and actuators.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:31.125
In this lesson, we'll focus on how to develop and document a technical safety concept.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:33.270
We will take the functional safety requirements

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.000
and turn them into technical safety requirements.
