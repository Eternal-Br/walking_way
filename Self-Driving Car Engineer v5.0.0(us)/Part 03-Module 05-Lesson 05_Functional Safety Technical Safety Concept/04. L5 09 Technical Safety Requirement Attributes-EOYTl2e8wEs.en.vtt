00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Technical safety requirements have some of the same

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.630
attributes that we discussed for functional safety requirements.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.925
These attributes are ASIL,

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:14.990
fault tolerant time interval and description of safe state transition.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.824
The technical safety requirements,

00:00:16.824 --> 00:00:20.579
inherit ASILs from the functional safety requirements because

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.695
the safety requirements for the lane departure warning were ASIL C,

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:28.140
the technical safety requirements are ASIL C as well.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.465
The only exception is the last requirement for testing memory.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.930
This requirement is ASIL A because the standard says,

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:43.189
that the latent fault to deduction for ASIL C requirements can be labeled ASIL A.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:49.364
It would be possible to decompose ASILs as we did for the functional safety concept.

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.359
Fault tolerant time intervals,

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.609
might need to be adjusted for each technical safety requirement.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.259
But for the purposes of this discussion,

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:03.379
we will use the fault tolerant time intervals from the functional safety requirement.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.655
So for all of the technical safety requirements of the lane departure warning function,

00:01:08.655 --> 00:01:11.820
the time interval shall be 50 milliseconds.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.259
Once again, the technical safety requirements for memory test is an exception.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.510
Here, the fault tolerant time interval would take into account the time to

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.730
check for memory corruption and

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.380
the failure of the system to detect the memory corruption.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.375
The system will do this on start up.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.114
We can consider the fault tolerant time interval

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:34.839
to be the length of the vehicle ignition cycle.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.359
The safe state for all of these faults is that,

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.094
the lane departure warning talk request amplitude shall be set to zero.

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:47.905
We're providing a table with the results we have so far.

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:50.177
With the technical safety requirements defined,

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:54.530
the next step is to allocate these requirements to the system architecture.
