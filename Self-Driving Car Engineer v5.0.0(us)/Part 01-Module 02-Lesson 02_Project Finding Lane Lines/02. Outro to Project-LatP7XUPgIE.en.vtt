00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.679
&gt;&gt; Great job so far.

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:04.945
In this lesson, you've used image analysis techniques like

00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:10.140
Canny edge detection and Hough transforms to find lane lines in images.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.830
These are the exact same techniques that you're going to need for the first project.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.969
So, Ryan, what will students be doing for the first project?

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:19.679
&gt;&gt; Well, your goal in this first project is to write

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.989
a software pipeline to identify and

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.024
track the position of the lane lines in a video stream.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.459
That might sound complicated,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.530
but don't worry, you can do it.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.035
A video is really just a series of images,

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:35.054
so you already have the tools you need to do this project.

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:37.200
&gt;&gt; Awesome. This project is

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.650
your first step toward becoming a real self-driving car engineer.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.649
And in fact, this was one of my first projects when I was

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.179
learning to become a self-driving car engineer. So, let's get to it.
