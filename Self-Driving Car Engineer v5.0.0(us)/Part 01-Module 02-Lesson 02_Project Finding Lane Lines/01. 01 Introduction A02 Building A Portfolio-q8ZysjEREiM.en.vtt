00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
All right. We'll let you now work on data obtained here in California,

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.809
image data to do lane finding,

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.730
and the data is obtained from a highway called 280,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.175
which is a very scenic California highway.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.020
We do this for two reasons.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.279
One is, we want you to sharpen your tools,

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:16.730
and understand, and learn,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.505
and practice how to be effective in lane marking findings and lane finding,

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:25.875
but we also want you to begin assembling your portfolio.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:29.274
Employers love looking at student portfolios.

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:33.699
Having worked on real data with real results is typically very, very impressive.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.040
So, take this unit seriously and do a great job.
