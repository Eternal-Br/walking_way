00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
In this lesson, you learned about

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.235
finite state machines which are a solution to the behavior planning problem.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:08.699
Finite state machines generally do well for small state spaces,

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.684
like when you're on a highway, for example.

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:13.225
For more complex scenarios like urban driving,

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:14.910
other approaches might be more suitable.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.246
In the final project,

00:00:16.246 --> 00:00:20.250
you'll be programming a planner for highway driving where you will have the chance

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
to gain experience working with your own finite state machine. So, safe driving.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.000
And happy decision making.
