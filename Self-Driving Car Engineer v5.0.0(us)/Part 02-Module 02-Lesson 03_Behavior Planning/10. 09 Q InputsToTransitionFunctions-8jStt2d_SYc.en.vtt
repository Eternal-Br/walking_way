00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.049
You just saw how the states we choose to use can impact the behavior of the vehicle.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.660
But deciding how those states transition and what inputs

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.359
the transition functions use is crucial to

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.924
the actual implementation of a finite-state machine.

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:18.269
For the example with the vending machine,

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.695
the only input was the coin.

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:23.795
The self-driving car is more complicated.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.405
So the question is,

00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:30.035
what data will we need to pass into our transition function as input.

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:32.000
Check all that apply.
