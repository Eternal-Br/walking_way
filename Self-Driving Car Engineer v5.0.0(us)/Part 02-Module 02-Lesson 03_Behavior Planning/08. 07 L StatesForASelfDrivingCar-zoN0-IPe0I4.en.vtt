00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.840
When we're thinking about a simple vending machine it's easy to enumerate the states.

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.164
Now let's consider the states we may want to model for car driving on a highway.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:13.139
Benny, let's just throw out all the ideas we can come up with and then prune the list

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.269
afterwards so we can show how we might think about

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.059
coming up with a finite state machine from scratch.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.829
Okay, let's keep it simple first.

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.214
What happens if we are the only car on the road?

00:00:24.214 --> 00:00:28.019
I guess we would need a state for normal staying in your lane driving.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.850
If we are changing lanes,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.001
we want a state to represent that.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.247
Or maybe two states since changing lanes to the left is different than to the right.

00:00:36.247 --> 00:00:40.885
Okay. I guess. What changes if there's a vehicle in front of us?

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:43.195
Well we might want to stay behind it,

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:47.219
so we should have a state for that or we might want to pass it.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.589
I suppose, but isn't

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.215
pass just a lane change to the left and then a lane change to the right?

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:55.720
Do we really need in your state for that?

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.856
Hey, we're brainstorming no bad ideas.

00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:03.905
Okay, fine. Well, what changes if we had more cars?

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:08.030
I could imagine in this situation you might want to slow down so that you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.140
could merge into this gap here and then pass this car if it's going slow.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.525
We should really have a slow downstate

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:18.155
which I guess means we will also need a speed upstate.

00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:23.329
We should probably add a stop state in case there is some emergency situation.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.234
I guess we could do all of that at once by having a keep target speed state.

00:01:27.234 --> 00:01:29.299
Well I don't know.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.602
Shouldn't speed just be dictated by the lane you're driving in and the speed limit?

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:38.150
What if we just add a prepare lane change state to represent when

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.445
the ego vehicle is trying to go next to an empty gap in traffic before a lane change?

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:45.679
Yeah, that could work but we should probably have

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.692
a prepare lane change left and to prepare a lane change right,

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:51.034
since those really are different maneuvers.

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:53.659
Oh, and we could also turn on the turn signals down.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.734
Good point. The truth is there isn't a single correct set of states to choose from.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.609
On one hand we want to keep our state space as small as

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.634
possible for maintainability reasons,

00:02:04.634 --> 00:02:07.670
but on the other hand we want to make sure we have enough logical States

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.939
to actually represent all the physical states that we care about.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.050
As you've seen in the discussion we've just had it's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.980
not easy to find the perfect set of states for this scenario.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.039
Why don't you think for a minute about what states you would want

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.965
to use to represent vehicle behavior on a highway.

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:29.189
Check the boxes next to each state that you'd keep and

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.000
write any additional ones in the empty boxes on the left.
