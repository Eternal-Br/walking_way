00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.825
In the self-driving car behavior selection,

00:00:02.825 --> 00:00:05.880
you're facing now one of the most challenging task of building

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.179
a self-driving car where the topic is, what to do next.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.309
And not on this minute level of like

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.440
what exact control input to give a steering wheel but more of

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.169
a macroscopic level whether to the left or

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.380
right or change lanes of a highway or take an exit.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:22.049
So we're going to look into finite state machines have govern

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.900
the complex behavior of a driving car.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.314
And one thing I can promise you, once you've done it,

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:31.280
you will never look at your own driving skills the same way as before.
