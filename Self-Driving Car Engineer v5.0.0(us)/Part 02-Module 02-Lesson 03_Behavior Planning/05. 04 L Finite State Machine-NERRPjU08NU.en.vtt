00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.885
In the previous demonstration, the navigator gave various suggestions about what to do next.

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:08.160
And the instructions they gave were about things like changing lanes,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.950
follow a lanes, turning and so on.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.530
But in fact there really aren't that many types of

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.385
suggestions you would expect to hear from a navigator.

00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:20.580
In this lesson we're going to teach an approach to behavior planning that

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.915
uses something called a Finite State Machine to solve the behavior planning problem.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:29.815
A Finite State Machine makes decisions based on a finite set of discrete states.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:31.515
In this example five.

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:35.436
When initialized, a Finite State Machine begins in some start state,

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:37.170
let's call it S0.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.840
Any pair of states within the finite state machine

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.880
can be connected by one or more transitions.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.335
And sometimes there is a transition back to the same state.

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:48.300
This is called a Self Transition.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.625
Not all transitions are necessarily possible.

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:54.030
For example, S4 doesn't transition to any other state.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.260
In the language of finite state machines this would be called an Accepting State.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.745
For non-accepting states that can often be multiple potential successor states.

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:05.460
To decide which state to transition to next,

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.060
a Finite State Machine needs to handle some sort of input and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.110
then use a state transition function to decide what state to go next.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.720
We'll talk more about transition functions and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.380
the states associated with a self driving car in a minute.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.550
But first, we want to formalize what a Finite State Machine is,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.000
with the help of a simple example.
