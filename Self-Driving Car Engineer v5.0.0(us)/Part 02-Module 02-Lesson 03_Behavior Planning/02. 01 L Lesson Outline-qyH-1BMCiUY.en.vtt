00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.209
Hey, I'm Tobi.

00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:02.100
And I'm Ben.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.660
And we are software engineers at Mercedes-Benz,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.950
who work in the behavior planning team.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.199
The behavior planning team is responsible for providing guidance to

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:15.404
the trajectory planner about what sorts of maneuvers they should plan trajectories for.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:17.519
If you think about the over all flow of data in

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.899
a self-driving car operating on the fastest time scales you have control.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:24.989
And with a slightly lower frequency than that you have Sensor Fusion.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.449
Just lower than that you have localization and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.640
trajectory planning which you learn more about in a next lesson.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.829
Next is Prediction which you just learned about.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.984
And then at the top of this diagram is behavior planning with the lowest update rate.

00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:39.689
The inputs to behavior planning come from

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.744
the prediction module and the localization module.

00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:44.737
Both of which get their inputs from the sensor fusion.

00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:49.034
And the output from the behavior module goes directly to the trajectory planner.

00:00:49.034 --> 00:00:51.599
Which also takes input from prediction and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.820
localization so that it can send trajectories to the motion controller.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.649
Everything inside of this box is the focus of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.960
this course and is commonly referred to as Path Planning.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.109
In this lesson, you will learn what exactly has to

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:06.415
happen in this comparatively long time span.

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:08.700
But intuitively this longtime span comes from

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.310
the fact that the behavior plan has to incorporate a lot of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.875
data to make decisions about

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:16.450
fairly long time horizons in the order of 10 seconds or even more.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.900
We will start by doing a brief introduction where

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.570
you'll learn more about the details of the inputs and

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.119
outputs to behavior planner and understand

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.450
what problems a behavior planning module is expected to solve.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.829
Next, we will talk about

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.250
Finite State Machines as one technique for implementing a behavior plan.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.829
Followed by a more in-depth look at

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.810
the Cost Functions we will use to actually make behavioral level decisions.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.250
But first let's spend some time looking at the inputs

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.790
we would be working with and the outputs we will be generating.
