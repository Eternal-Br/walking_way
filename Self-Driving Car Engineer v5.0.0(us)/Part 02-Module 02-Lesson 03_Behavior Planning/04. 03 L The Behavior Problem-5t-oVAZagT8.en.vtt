00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.654
Imagine you're driving in a city with your friend.

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:05.000
You have a goal that you're trying to get to.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.429
You are sitting in the passenger seat and your friend is driving.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.709
You plug that goal into Google Maps and you

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.434
get some route that will get you to your destination.

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:18.329
The driver shouldn't be concerned about the details of what the route exactly is.

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.689
Right, because the driver trusts that you acting, as the navigator,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.970
will tell them what maneuvers they need to make and it's

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.714
understood that they are just responsible for executing them.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:29.730
In this situation, the responsibilities of the passenger are

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.520
analogous to the responsibilities of a behavior planner in a self-driving car.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.926
So if you tell your friend to go left, they will do that.

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:39.210
And when you tell the driver to pass a slow vehicle,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.719
the driver won't worry about whether they have enough time to do so because they

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.414
will assume that you have thought about that

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:46.460
and that you're confident that they can make it.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.350
But the navigator is not responsible for safety.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.700
If you tell the driver to get back to the left lane but there is a vehicle in the way,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.890
you will assume that they will wait to move

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.820
left until there is enough room to do so safely.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.159
The navigator will also tell the driver when to keep their lane and when it is

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.729
time to turn or change lanes or maybe adjust the speed.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.924
And finally, once you're arrived at your destination,

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:10.950
you will tell the driver to stop.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.890
So, to summarize, the behavior planner is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.299
currently a black box which takes as input a map of the world,

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.869
a route to the destinations,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.814
and predictions about what other static and dynamic obstacles are likely to do,

00:01:22.814 --> 00:01:26.159
and it produces as output a adjusted maneuver for the vehicle which

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.539
the trajectory planner is responsible for reaching collision-free, smooth, and safe.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.160
The goal of this lesson is to open up

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.965
this black box and learn how to implement a behavior planner.

00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:36.810
So the responsibilities of

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.859
the behavior module are to suggest maneuvers which are feasible,

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.560
as safe as possible, legal, and efficient.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.600
What the behavior planner is not responsible

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.839
for are execution details and collision avoidance.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.540
The approach to behavior planning we are going to teach in

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.109
this lesson is the same one used by most of the vehicles,

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.480
including the winning one in the DARPA Urban Challenge.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.000
In fact, it's the approach to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.525
behavior planning that Mercedes used in their Bertha Benz Drive,

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:05.730
which you can see is capable of handling

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.240
complex traffic situations like navigating intersections and dense urban traffic.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.725
And while this approach is not necessarily the most common anymore,

00:02:13.724 --> 00:02:15.449
for reasons we will discuss later,

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.389
it is widely known in the field and it does give

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.589
a very high-level understanding of what is going on in a behavior planner.
