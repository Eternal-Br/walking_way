We've created a short course around interviewing specifically for roles in autonomous systems - titles like Deep Learning Engineer, Perception Engineer, Sensors Engineer, and Motion Planning Engineer are all examples of possible positions in the field. If you are taking the Nanodegree for career-oriented reasons, you should make sure to check it out! You can find it under the *Extracurricular* section on the left when you click out of the lesson. \n\nEven if you are not looking to change roles, there are a lot of additional questions at the end of the course that could help you find some more topics to learn about in your area of interest!",

For a full list of supported countries and IDs please be sure check <a href=\"https://www.jumio.com/netverify/supported-countries/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. If you do not see your country or ID type on this list please contact support@udacity.com. \n\n# Final Survey \nAlmost done!  After you've verified your identity, you will also need to complete a final survey.  This is an opportunity to reflect back on all the things you have learned and prepare for the next stage in your career.\n\n# Thank You\nWe are so proud of you! Graduating from the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program demands an impressive array of skills, and an outstanding commitment to becoming a self-driving car engineer.\n\nAs you go out into the world, we hope that what you have learned here contributes to your success. We especially hope that one day, maybe sooner or maybe later, you are in a position to mentor or hire or otherwise help future Udacity students grow in their own careers.\n\nThank you so much for taking this journey with us :-)",
