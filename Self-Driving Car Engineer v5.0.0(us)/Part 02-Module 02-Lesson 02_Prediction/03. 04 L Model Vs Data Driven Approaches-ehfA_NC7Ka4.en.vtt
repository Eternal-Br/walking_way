00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Imagine a T-shaped intersection.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.630
The blue self-driving car pulls up to that stop sign and would

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.469
like to make a left turn but it sees this green car coming from the left.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.935
If the green car is turning right,

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:16.054
it is safe for the blue car to go.

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:18.989
But if the green car is going straight,

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.084
then the blue car should wait.

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:24.955
The way we would handle this with the model based approach is as follows.

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:27.899
First we would come up with two process models,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.344
one for going straight and one for turning right.

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:35.129
And we would use some simple trajectory generator to figure out

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.040
what trajectory we would expect to see if

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.460
the driver were going straight or turning right.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.265
Then we would pay attention to the actual behavior of the target vehicle and using

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:51.954
a multimodal estimation algorithm which is still a black box for now we would

00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:57.244
compare observed trajectory to the ones we would expect for each of our models.

00:00:57.244 --> 00:00:59.864
And then based on that we would

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:04.375
assign a probability to each of the possible trajectories.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:08.670
But the important takeaway for purely model based prediction is that we

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.320
have some bank of possible behaviors and each has a mathematical model of

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:18.059
motion which takes into account the physical capabilities of the object as well

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.040
as the constraints imposed by the road traffic laws and other restrictions.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.290
What about a data driven approach.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.340
Well with the purely data driven approach we have

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.454
a truly blackbox algorithm and this algorithm will be trained on lots of training data.

00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:37.709
Once it's trained we just fitted

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.604
the observed behavior and let it make a prediction about what will happen next.

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:46.245
So we can see that each approach has its own strengths.

00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:49.320
Model based approaches incorporate our knowledge of

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.839
physics constraints imposed by the road traffic et cetera and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.460
data driven approaches are nice because they let us use data to

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:05.459
extract subtle patterns that would otherwise be missed by model based approaches.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.379
For example differences in

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.389
vehicle behavior at an intersection during different times of the day.

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.939
And this leads to the somewhat leading question.

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.000
Which approach is the best.
