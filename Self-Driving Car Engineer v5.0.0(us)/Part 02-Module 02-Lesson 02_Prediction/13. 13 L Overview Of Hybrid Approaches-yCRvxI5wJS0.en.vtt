00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
So far you have seen that prediction can be done

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.930
with model based or data driven approaches and you

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.975
learned that model based approaches incorporate

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:14.205
our knowledge of the objects motion dynamics with process models,

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:19.385
handle uncertainty on maneuvers using multimodal estimators,

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:24.510
and you have seen that there are many ways to implement model based approaches.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.320
In learning about data driven approaches you saw that there are

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.220
many versions of "data driven" approaches and that these approaches

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.380
can extract subtle patterns from training data which means they can

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.270
produce predictions which are very well tailored to a specific driving situation.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.010
In practice, the best way to do prediction is often by taking

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.350
a hybrid approach that takes advantage of the strengths of both types of approaches.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.435
Remember earlier when we talked about how model based approaches

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:59.730
combine process models with a multimodal estimator?

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.070
Well, the multimodal estimator could be replaced with a machine learning approach.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.615
To replace that component with a machine learning approach,

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:12.390
the type of algorithm we need is a classifier.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.820
In the next few slides we will talk about

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.000
how one such classifier known as Naive Bayes classifier works.
