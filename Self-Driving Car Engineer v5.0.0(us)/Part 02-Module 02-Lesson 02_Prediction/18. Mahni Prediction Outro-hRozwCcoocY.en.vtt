00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
In this lesson, you learned about the prediction problem,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.865
and the two main classes of solutions.

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.825
Model-based solutions and data-driven solutions.

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:12.450
We also discussed one particular hybrid approach,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.265
which uses Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict driver behavior.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.025
There is no one correct approach.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:24.830
That's part of what makes the prediction problems so fundamentally difficult.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.060
In this lesson, we actually made

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.850
a simplifying assumption by only considering one object at a time.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.920
If you want to take into account multiple objects,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.570
then also you have to account for the interactions between objects.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.070
These interactions get very complex, very quickly.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.630
Fortunately, even when we only consider one object at a time,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.530
we can still make useful predictions.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.120
This is especially true during highway driving,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.230
which is the situation you'll be dealing with in the final Project.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.290
Good luck, and safe driving.
