00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.099
We have talked about individual process models but we haven't yet talked

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:11.070
about how to maintain some beliefs about which behavior the driver intends to perform.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.089
This is the role of multimodal estimation algorithms.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.149
A simple approach to multimodal estimation is called

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:21.879
autonomous multiple model estimation or AMM.

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:25.169
While describing AMM, I will use

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.240
the same notation that is used in a paper which I will link to later.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.140
The variable M represents the number of process models or

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.090
behaviors and each variable mu represents the probability of behavior.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.161
To understand how these probabilities are computed,

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:46.304
let's go back to our T intersection example.

00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:49.465
Let's say we have two process models here.

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:56.580
One to go straight and one to turn right and they both have Gaussian uncertainty.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.945
Let's say that we observe this state for the vehicle at time k minus one and we observe

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:08.640
this state for the vehicle at time k. In order to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.650
compute the new probabilities for the behaviors based on the new observation,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.050
we will run our two process models for

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.700
one step starting from the state at time k minus one.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.945
When we do this,

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:27.989
we get these two expected states for time k. If we just look at what

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.929
the distribution on the vehicle's s coordinate looks

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.335
like for the two expected states, this is what we see.

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:41.032
Where the red curve gives the probability density function of S for turning right,

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.769
the blue curve represents going straight

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:47.564
and the observation at timestep k is somewhere here.

00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:51.179
We can see that this observation is substantially more

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.040
consistent with turn right than it is with go straight.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.160
This is measured by the likelihood of the observation as

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.369
for each model and the probability of

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.655
each behavior is a function of these likelihoods

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:09.390
and of the probabilities computed in the previous timestep.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.009
The important quantity for the AMM is

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:20.274
the ratio of these likelihoods after they get multiplied by the previous probability.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:24.106
The equation ends up looking like this,

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:28.335
where this term is the probability of model I

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:32.835
at timestep K. This term is the probability of

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:36.620
model I at timestep K minus one and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.289
this L term is the likelihood of the observation at time K for that model.

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:49.049
The denominator just serves to normalize our probabilities so that they all sum to one.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.000
M, in this situation would be two since we are only considering two maneuvers.
