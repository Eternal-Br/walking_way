00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
3In this lesson, you learned about

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:05.889
the prediction problem and the two main classes of solutions,

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:10.335
model based solutions and data driven solutions.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:14.010
You also learned about one particular hybrid approach which uses

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.995
a Gaussian naive bayes classifier to predict driver behavior.

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:21.640
There isn't any one correct approach.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.810
That's part of what makes the prediction problem so fundamentally difficult.

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:28.299
In fact, in this lesson we actually made

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.875
a simplifying assumption by only considering one object at a time.

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:35.810
If you were to take into account multiple objects,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.540
then you would also have to take into account interactions between those objects.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.424
These interactions can get very complex, very quickly.

00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:48.619
Fortunately, even when you only consider one object at a time,

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:51.289
you can still make useful predictions.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.689
This is especially true during highway driving

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.375
which is the situation you'll be dealing with in the final project.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.000
Good luck and safe driving.
