00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
Data driven approaches can be very useful

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:07.019
particularly when we have access to plenty of training data.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.480
But in some ways purely data driven approaches are naÃ¯ve since they rely

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.460
solely on historical evidence to make predictions about likely future behavior.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.094
Ideally, we would also like to include, in our predictions,

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:25.349
all the insights we have about driver behavior,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.320
physics, or vehicle dynamics.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.510
This is where model based approaches can help.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.484
The way these approaches typically work is as follows.

00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:39.420
For each object identify all the behaviors

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.685
that object is likely to do in the current situation.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:47.230
The behavior for a vehicle could be something like change lanes,

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.634
turn left and for a pedestrian,

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:52.619
it could be cross the street on pedestrian crossing.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.259
For our intersection scenario,

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:57.719
the behaviors could be go straight,

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.594
turn left, turn right.

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:05.069
Whatever it is, it needs to be something that we can describe mathematically.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:10.064
Step two, define a process model for each behavior.

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:15.340
A process model is a mathematical description of object motion for behavior.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.930
It is a function which can be used to compute the state of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.650
the object at time t_plus_1 from the state at

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.130
time t. The process model must

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:30.765
incorporate some uncertainty which represents how much we trust our model.

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:33.209
In our intersection example,

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:39.104
the left turn process model would produce an uncertain future state located roughly here.

00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:44.969
The going straight process model would produce an uncertain future state located roughly

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.760
here and the right turn process model would

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.750
produce an uncertain future state located roughly here.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.620
If you keep running the process models your uncertainty will increase.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.014
Once we have a process model for each behavior we can go to the next step,

00:02:02.013 --> 00:02:04.709
step three, which is to use

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.759
the process models to compute the probability of each behavior.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.544
This is done by taking the observed state of the object at time t_minus_1,

00:02:13.544 --> 00:02:18.804
running the process models to compute the expected state of the object at time t.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.110
Then we compare the observed state of the object at

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.935
time t with what our process models predicted.

00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:32.854
And we use a multimodal estimation algorithm to derive the probability of each maneuver.

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:36.914
The purpose of these algorithms is to maintain some belief about

00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:41.340
how likely it is that the driver intends to perform each behavior.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.200
We'll go into more detail later.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.849
But in this case the probability of going straight

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.859
or turning left would be higher than the probability of turning right.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.015
The fourth and final step is to predict a trajectory for each behavior.

00:02:58.014 --> 00:03:01.169
This is done easily by iterating on

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.099
the process models until the prediction horizon is reached.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.974
In the following videos,

00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:12.569
we talk more about the process models we use to model behaviors and then

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.219
discuss one version of

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:19.000
multimodal estimation algorithm that can be used to maintain beliefs.
