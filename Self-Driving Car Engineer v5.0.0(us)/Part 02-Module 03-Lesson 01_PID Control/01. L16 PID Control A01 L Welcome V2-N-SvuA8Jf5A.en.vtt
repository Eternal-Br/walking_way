00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.885
Welcome to Control.

00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:03.990
Control is how we use the steering,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.515
throttle, and breaks to move a car where we want it to go.

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:11.164
Our friend, Andrew Gray from Uber Advanced Technology Group,

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:14.289
wrote his PhD dissertation on control theory.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.605
Control's a trickier problem than it might seem.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:18.390
When human turns through an intersection,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.795
we use our intuition and experience to determine how hard to steer,

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:22.990
and when to accelerate,

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.945
and whether we ever need to step on the brakes.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:27.070
Teaching a computer how to do this is hard.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.730
Control algorithms are often called controllers,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.130
and one of the most common and fundamental controllers is the PID controller.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.359
In this lesson, you'll learn from Sebastian how to implement a PID controller in Python.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.600
Then, you'll dive into the Udacity simulator to implement a PID controller in C++.
