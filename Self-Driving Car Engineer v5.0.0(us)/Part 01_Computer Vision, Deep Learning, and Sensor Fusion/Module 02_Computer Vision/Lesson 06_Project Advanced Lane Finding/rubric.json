  "stand_out": "For a standout submission, you should follow the suggestion in the lesson to not just search blindly for the lane lines in each frame of video, but rather, once you have a high-confidence detection, use that to inform the search for the position of the lines in subsequent frames of video.  For example, if a polynomial fit was found to be robust in the previous frame, then rather than search the entire next frame for the lines, just a window around the previous detection could be searched.  This will improve speed and provide a more robust method for rejecting outliers.  \n\nFor an additional improvement you should implement outlier rejection and use a low-pass filter to smooth the lane detection over frames, meaning add each new detection to a weighted mean of the position of the lines to avoid jitter.  \n\nIf you really want to go above and beyond, implement these methods on the challenge videos as well, or on your own videos you've recorded yourself.
