00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
My immediate answer is it would never get in certain situation like this.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.240
It's a way too careful.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.565
We're sad if that situation happened.

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:11.279
And then, secondly, I think it's

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.884
a great thing for philosophers to discuss these kind of problems.

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:18.067
They can get tenure over the universities,

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:19.920
but it's not of practical relevance.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.020
If we the manage with certain car technology to hasten the traffic deaths in the world,

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.219
which means if we are able to have 500,000 fewer deaths in total,

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:32.594
then for this extremely rare,

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:38.144
purely hypothetical, only if I really discuss the problems of trolleys,

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:41.300
that might occur once in a hundred years.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:44.174
I think whatever the outcome is,

00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:48.689
the mental energy that philosophers have spent on discussing is completely out of

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:53.189
proportion to the benefit of others on one problem and then leave it at that.
