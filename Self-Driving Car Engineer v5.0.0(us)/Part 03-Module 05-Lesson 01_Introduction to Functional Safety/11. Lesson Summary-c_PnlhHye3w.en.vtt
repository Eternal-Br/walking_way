00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
Before we head to the next lesson,

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:04.480
let's summarize what we have gone over so far.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.980
Safety involves reducing risks to reasonable levels.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.551
We achieve safe systems by identifying hazards that could lead to accidents.

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:16.539
Then we evaluate the risk of each hazard.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.780
Finally, we use systems engineering to lower risks to acceptable levels.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.145
Today's society defines what's an acceptable risk.

00:00:24.144 --> 00:00:26.445
Functional safety in the automotive industry

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:30.115
specifically refers to reducing risk in electronic systems.

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:35.284
ISO 26262 is a guideline for achieving automotive functional safety.

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:36.869
It's a standard philosophy model.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.409
In the next lesson,

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:43.469
we would discuss the safety plan which describes what we plan to do to achieve functional
