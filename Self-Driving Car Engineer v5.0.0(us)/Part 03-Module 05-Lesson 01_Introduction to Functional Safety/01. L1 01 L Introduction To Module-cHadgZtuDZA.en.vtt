00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome to functional safety.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.540
In this module, you'll learn how to analyze and design automotive systems to reduce risk.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.416
Three functional safety experts from Elektrobit,

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:14.940
Dheeraj, Stephanie, and Benjamin will be leading the module.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.460
Within the module, you'll use the framework provided by ISO 26262,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.595
the international standard on functional safety.

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:28.680
Functional safety is an important part of designing autonomous vehicles and it's often

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.004
a difficult skill set to acquire because it is so specific to the automotive industry.

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.785
We're excited for you to learn these skills and we hope that, eventually,

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:40.500
you'll have the opportunity to apply them in designing

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.865
safe, functional, self-driving cars.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.020
Hi, my name is Stephanie Hollyer.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.340
I'm a validation and verification manager for Elekrobit's U. S. operations.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.720
My job is to ensure all of

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.050
our internal products get properly tested before going into production.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.880
And I'm Benjamin Brentrop.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.145
I'm a functional safety manager at Elektrobit in Germany.

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:03.315
My background is in automotive system software development.

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:04.780
For the past six years,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.130
I've worked in the area of functional safety for instrument clusters,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.765
transmission control, avick controls and body control units.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:14.040
Hi my name is Deeraj Sharma.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.467
I'm a senior software engineer at Elektrobit.

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:18.900
Part of my responsibilities is to identify

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.480
mechanisms needed to satisfy software safety requirements.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.055
Elektrobit supplies software to automotive manufacturers and suppliers around the world.

00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:29.800
Our customers expect our products to be safe.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.120
So, as a company, we have a methodical approach to designing,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.000
building, and testing our systems and products.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.555
We are looking forward to teaching you

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:40.000
functional safety techniques that help ensure automotive
