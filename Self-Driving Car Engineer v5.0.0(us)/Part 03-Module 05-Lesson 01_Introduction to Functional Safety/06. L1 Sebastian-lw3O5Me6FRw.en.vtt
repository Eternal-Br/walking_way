00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
So talk about the complexity of bugs.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.250
My students built the computing infrastructure

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.814
for standee and computers and power systems.

00:00:08.814 --> 00:00:10.724
And we had a backup battery in case

00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:13.169
our main battery failed and all these wonderful things,

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:14.669
and everything worked fine.

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.611
For months, we would go out every day and drive the car until summer hit.

00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:25.115
Summer hit, and we broke an alternator. It just was fried.

00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:26.474
So we took the engine out,

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:27.750
put an alternator in,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.295
kept driving. We broke another alternator.

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:32.975
We took the engine out, engine back in,

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:37.215
and it invokes on tour it gets an expensive procedure to replace alternator,

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:39.315
and to cap off another half week, alternator problem.

00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:42.335
No clue what's happening.

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:43.800
Now, we measured everything.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:45.119
We went into the system,

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:48.744
try to understand anything more about the- but the load of the alternator was just fine.

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:51.544
We couldn't find anything. And then,

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:55.770
it turned out to be one of this really bizarre bugs.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.295
The students had tried to make a distinction,

00:00:58.295 --> 00:00:59.940
is the car running or not,

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.589
and normally the car is running,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.635
it supplies enough voltage that the voltage of our system exceeds 12.5 volts.

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:09.810
So they would say, if the car is running,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.305
we take the power from our main car source,

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.067
turn it off but it is not running,

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.104
we take it from the spare battery, okay?

00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:20.585
So the car was running.

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:23.609
It was warm, the air conditioned was full blast,

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.730
and even though it's running the voltage drops just

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.820
below 12.5 volt which told our system,

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.750
oh cars off, sure it's off,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.859
cars off, reserve battery.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.359
So our power system would go from full draw of power from the cause alternator,

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.954
to zero at all within a tenth of a second.

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:44.849
Now of course the moment it took the power away from the main car,

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.530
it recovers, and the voltage goes above 12.5 volt.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.689
In which case our passes went back with the car.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.745
So we effectively were switching between full load

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:57.775
and zero load 10 times a second for the alternator.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.000
Now when we use digital volt meters,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.040
we couldn't see it, because it will smooth it out.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.250
We had to take an analog altimeter to see all these bumps and realize,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.484
oh my God on average we're doing fine but in reality,

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:10.395
we're drawing 100 and 0 amp, a 100 and 0 amp,

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:12.445
a 100 and 0 amp within like,

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:14.019
10th of seconds to each other,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.784
and that cause the alternators to break.

00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:17.810
Again it took us forever to find this bug,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.390
and I'm so glad we found it.
