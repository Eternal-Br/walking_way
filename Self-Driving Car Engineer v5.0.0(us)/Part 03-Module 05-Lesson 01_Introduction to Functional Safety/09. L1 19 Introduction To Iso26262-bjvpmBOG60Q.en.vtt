00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.774
You have now learned the basics of functional safety,

00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:05.910
hazard identification, evaluating risk,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.675
and using systems engineering to lower risk.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.600
It's time to introduce the international functional safety standard, ISO 26262.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.980
ISO 26262 provides a framework

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.785
for dealing with electronic system malfunctions in passenger vehicles.

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:25.410
In other words, the standard helps you ensure that if your vehicle systems do

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.750
not behave as intended the vehicle will not cause injury or harm to a person's health.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.939
Remember the V model we have discussed previously.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:40.064
ISO 26262 uses the V model to cover the entire vehicle safety lifecycle from planning,

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:44.769
designing, testing, production, and post-production.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.980
Let's take a look at the V model.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.119
It's a little bit more complex than the V model we looked at before,

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.669
but the principles are the same.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.820
The left side represents system planning and design.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.475
The right side shows system testing and integration.

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:06.299
The bottom of the V represents subsystems while the top integrated systems.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.640
Note that the V model makes a clear distinction

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.420
between hardware development and software development.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.409
Each one has its own miniature V model within the larger model.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.200
Note also that you can connect to the left side of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.040
the V and right side of the V with horizontal lines.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.655
For every test and integration step.

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:28.200
You can go back and verify that the product being

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.880
developed actually matches the design specifications.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.581
In the rest of the lessons,

00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:37.489
we will go into the details about the planning and design phase.

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:40.959
We will be focusing on these specific parts of the V model.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:46.349
We will use the Lane Assistance System example to study the concept phase,

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.989
product development at system level,

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.854
and product development at software and hardware level.

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:56.549
You will gain a basic understanding of what it takes to achieve

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.000
ISO 26262 compliance when designing an automotive system.
