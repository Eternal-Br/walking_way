00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
We have now discussed the main goal of functional safety,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.865
identifying hazards and lowering risks to acceptable level.

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:10.169
So one of the first steps in functional safety analysis is to

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:14.969
identify hazards that could cause injury or harm a person's health.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.519
Vehicles have a lot of safety features that we take for granted today.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.689
But many safety features such as padded dashboards, headrests,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.545
and windshield glass came about because vehicles were actually causing injuries.

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:32.655
In functional safety, we want to identify hazards before they ever cause injury.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:37.920
We do not want to wait for an injury to happen and then identify the hazards after.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.405
But how do you identify these potential hazards? It takes brainstorming.

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:44.429
As a functional safety engineer,

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.590
you will take a cross-section of personnel from

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.310
your company to help out with the brainstorming process.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.780
You have to imagine a lot of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.085
different scenarios and situations that could lead to accidents.

00:00:56.085 --> 00:00:58.064
To help you identify hazards,

00:00:58.064 --> 00:01:02.589
we are going to discuss three general causes of accidents: Errors caused by humans.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.260
errors from technology and errors caused by human technology interaction.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.730
This is just an introduction to hazard analysis.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.230
In the following lesson,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.000
we will give you a more formal framework for identifying hazards.
