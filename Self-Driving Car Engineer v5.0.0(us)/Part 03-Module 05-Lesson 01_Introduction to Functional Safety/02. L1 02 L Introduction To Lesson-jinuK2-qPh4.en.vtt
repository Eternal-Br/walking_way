00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.515
So what exactly is functional safety?

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:05.970
Any product will have certain requirements or

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:09.300
functions describing what the product is supposed to do.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.270
Our job as safety managers and engineers is

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.789
to make sure that these functions do not lead to injury or harm.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.678
In the automotive industry,

00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:21.949
functional safety specifically refers to reducing risk in electronic systems.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.599
Automotive functional safety was developed out of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.200
the increasing use of complex hardware and software systems in passenger vehicles.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.189
In this module, we introduce you to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.155
the main functional safety standards for the automotive industry,

00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:39.750
ISO 26262, the standard used in

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.015
systems engineering to methodically reduce risk in passenger vehicle's E/E-Systems.

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:49.721
Because functional safety is just one part of the overall automotive safety,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.116
we will start off with a general introduction to automotive safety.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:57.419
In this lesson, we also present the basic building blocks for

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.500
carrying out a functional safety analysis according to the ISO standard.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.890
The following lessons will go into the details of how we

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.000
use the standard to reduce risks in passenger vehicles.
