00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
Now that we have an idea about how to identify hazards,

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:08.388
we need to evaluate the risk associated with each hazard.

00:00:08.388 --> 00:00:14.140
Evaluating risk will be an important part of our more formal functional safety analysis.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.830
Every hazard has a certain risk associated with it.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.759
And since we are thinking like functional safety engineers,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.798
we are going to define risk numerically.

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:28.469
Risk equals severity of harm times probability of occurrence.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:34.469
Severity of harm measures how badly a person could be injured when an accident occurs.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.725
Probability of occurrence has a specific definition for passenger car functional safety.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.929
It is the frequency with which

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.070
typical drivers find themselves driving in a certain situation.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.094
For example, driving on a city street has

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:54.299
a high probability of occurrence because people do it everyday.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.759
Driving on a snowy mountainside has

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:02.474
a low probability because people hardly find themselves driving in those conditions.

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:04.680
Probability of occurrence only takes into

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.650
account how often you find yourself driving in a certain situation.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.048
It does not take into account how likely a malfunction will occur,

00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:14.519
like the probability of your brakes failing.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:16.109
Failing brakes would lead to

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.670
high severity but would not affect probability of occurrence.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.359
Let's go through an example of calculating risk.

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.609
We'll say that severity has a scale of one to four,

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.215
with one representing no injury and four representing fatal injury.

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:35.990
Probability of occurrence will also be on a scale from one to four,

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:39.804
one being an unlikely scenario like needing a jump start,

00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:43.380
while four will be a likely scenario like driving on a highway.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:45.739
Here's our scenario, you're driving on

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.655
a snowy mountain side pass and the power steering malfunctions.

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:55.125
I would say severity is a four because we could easily lose control of the vehicle,

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:59.216
driving off the mountainside and suffer a fatal injury.

00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:02.219
Probability of occurrence could be a two

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.724
because you would not find yourself driving on a snowy mountainside very often.

00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:11.914
Risk then is four times two equals eight.

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:13.734
In functional safety analysis,

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:18.670
we quantify risk to determine how much we need to lower the risk.

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.419
Vehicle systems with high risks require

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:26.489
more analysis and testing to bring the risk down to acceptable levels.
