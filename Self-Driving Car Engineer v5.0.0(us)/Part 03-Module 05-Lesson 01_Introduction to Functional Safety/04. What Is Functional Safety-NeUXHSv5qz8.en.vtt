00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
Now you'll start to think like

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:03.809
a functional safety engineer and

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.500
consider how you can be more methodical about your analysis.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.960
In functional safety, your goal is to identify high risk situations that could cause

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.382
harm and then you find ways to lower the risk to reasonable, acceptable levels.

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:21.730
Safety then is the absence of unreasonable risks.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.475
Functional safety at its most basic level involves three main things.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:30.045
Number one, identifying potential problems

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:33.340
that could injure people or damage people's health.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.705
We will call these potential problems hazards.

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:41.280
Number two, evaluating the risks of these hazards.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.814
Number three, using systems engineering to lower risks to acceptable levels.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:50.299
You ensure that hazards do not lead to accidents.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.869
Systems engineering helps you figure out what your vehicle needs to do and what

00:00:54.869 --> 00:01:00.780
your vehicle design needs to look like in order to remain as safe as reasonably possible.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.390
In practice the third part takes the most work

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.170
and will be the main focus of the functional safety module.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.034
Lowering risks involves designing safe systems,

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:14.000
testing your systems and documenting all designs and tests.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In the first lesson we will give you an overview of these three basic building blocks.
