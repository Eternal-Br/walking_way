00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.059
Let's look at my morning commute and discuss some hazards I might encounter along my way.

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:07.949
I might slam my fingers when I shut the car door.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.647
When I turn on the engine,

00:00:09.647 --> 00:00:12.894
the battery could blow up leaving me burned.

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:17.394
I leave the driveway in reverse and it might hit a trash can or worse,

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:19.329
run into a pedestrian.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:25.380
On the highway, my car might even flip over in a fiery accident and I break all my bones.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.750
My commute seems pretty scary.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.285
Yet despite all of these dangers,

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:35.189
I still get in my car and drive to work every weekday. But why?

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:40.344
The benefits of getting to work in my car outweigh the potential costs.

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:44.795
In other words, the risk seems reasonable to me and driving to work,

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.789
in my opinion, is a safe activity.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.219
Maybe another person sees my morning commute

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.659
as too risky and takes the train to work instead.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.819
Or another person will only drive on city streets at

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.810
low speed reducing the chance of a high speed accident.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.350
To other people, my morning commute seems like an unreasonable risk and therefore unsafe.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:10.104
We all have different risk tolerances and we do

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:14.060
these informal risk analysis all of the time in our everyday lives.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.329
We feel safe and we participate in activities that have reasonable risks.
