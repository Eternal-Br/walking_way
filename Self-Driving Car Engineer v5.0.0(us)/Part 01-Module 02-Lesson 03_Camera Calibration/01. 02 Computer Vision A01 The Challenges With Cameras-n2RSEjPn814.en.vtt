00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.379
So, very cool.

00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.884
You learned a lot about the very first steps OpenCV.

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:07.275
You found some lane markings on roads,

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:10.655
well done, but you're not an expert yet.

00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:13.500
Now, it's going to become more challenging.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.600
We're going to give you data that's more realistic, harder,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.400
you're going to find shades and curvature,

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.189
and you have to play around with new stuff.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.265
You have to understand camera geometry and color spaces much

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:26.609
more deeply on the way to become a computer vision expert.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.439
So, have fun.
