00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.259
&gt;&gt; In the very first module of these
nanodegree program, you used

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.639
some basic computer vision techniques
to find the lane lines on the road.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.859
The first thing you'll do in these
module, is to write a better lane

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.589
finding algorithm that deals with
complex scenarios like curving lines,

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.390
shadows and
changes in the color of the pavement.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.920
You'll measure things like how
much the lane is curving and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.460
where your vehicle is
with respect to center.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.320
These are the kinds of measurements you
ultimately need to make in order to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.960
control the car.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.820
&gt;&gt; After that, you'll implement
vehicle detection and tracking.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.840
While deciding when to change lanes,
when to accelerate, and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.870
when to hit the brakes, knowing where
the other vehicles are on the road

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:40.659
is crucial to
the decision-making process.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.869
Trust me, I have friends who
change lanes without looking, and

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:44.829
it doesn't end well.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.079
&gt;&gt; The project for
this module will come in two pieces.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.070
First, the advanced lane-finding piece.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.939
And second, the vehicle detection and
tracking piece.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.259
At the end, you'll combine these two
pieces to simultaneously measure

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:00.280
where the car is on the road,
where the road is going, and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.469
the location of other vehicles
in your field of view.
