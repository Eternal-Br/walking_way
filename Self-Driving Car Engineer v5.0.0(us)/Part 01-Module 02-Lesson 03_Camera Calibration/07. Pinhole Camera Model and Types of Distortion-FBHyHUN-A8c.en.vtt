00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.750
Before we get into the code and
start correcting for

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.919
distortion, let's get some intuition
as to how this distortion occurs.

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.529
Here's a simple model of a camera
called the pinhole camera model.

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.219
When the camera forms an image,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.310
it's looking at the world
similar to how our eyes do.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.810
By focusing the light that's reflected
off of objects in the world.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.679
In this case through a small pinhole,
the camera focuses the light that's

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.600
reflected off of a 3D traffic sign,
and forms a 2D image

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.750
at the back of the camera or
a sensor or some film would be placed.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.670
In fact the image it forms
here will be upside down, and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.740
reversed because rays of light that
enter from the top of an object 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.260
will continue on that angled path through the pinhole and

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:44.099
end up at the bottom
of the formed image.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.829
Similarly, light that reflects
off the right side of an object

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.600
will travel to the left
of the formed image.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.260
In math this transformation from 3D
object points, P of X, Y, and Z.

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:59.159
To 2D image points, P of just X, and

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.399
Y is done by a transformative
matrix called the camera matrix.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.409
Which I'll call C for camera and

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.420
we'll need this to calibrate
the camera later on.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.750
However, real cameras don't
use tiny pinholes like this,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.849
they use lenses to focus
multiple light rays at a time.

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:17.309
Which allows them to
quickly form images.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.210
But lenses can introduce distortion too.

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.669
Light rays often bend
a little too much or

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.290
too little at the edges of a curved lens
of a camera, and this creates the effect

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.690
we looked at earlier that
distorts the edges of images.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.120
So that lines or objects appear, more or
less, curved than they actually are.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.600
This is called radial distortion, and
it's the most common type of distortion.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:44.049
Another type, is tangential distortion,
if the camera's lens is not aligned

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.500
perfectly parallel to the imaging
plane where the camera film or

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.629
sensor is,
this makes an image look tilted.

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:55.269
So that some objects appear further
away or closer than they actually are.

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:57.459
And this is tangential distortion.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:02.349
There are even example of lenses that
purposefully distort images like fisheye

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:07.149
or wide angle lenses which keep radial
distortion for stylistic effect.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.800
But for
our purposes we are using this images

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.969
to position ourself driving car and
eventually steer it the right direction.

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.129
So we need undistorted images
that accurately reflect

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.129
our real world surroundings.

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.169
Luckily, this distortion can generally
be captured by five numbers called

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:27.399
distortion coefficients, whose values
reflect the amount of radial and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.819
tangential distortion in an image.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.019
In severely distorted cases,
sometimes even more than

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.130
five coefficients are required to
capture the amount of distortion.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.560
If we know these coefficients,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.849
we can use them to calibrate our
camera and undistort our images.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.979
And the mathematical
details of correcting for

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.889
distortion are in the notes below.

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.829
Next we'll see how to get these
coefficients and calibrate a camera.
