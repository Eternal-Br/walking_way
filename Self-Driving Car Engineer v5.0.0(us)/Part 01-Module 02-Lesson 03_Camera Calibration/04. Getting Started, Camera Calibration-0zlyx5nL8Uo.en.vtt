&gt;&gt; To help us with this module,
we have Sezan Camacho,

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.705
who is one of our resident computer
vision experts here at Udacity.

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:11.259
So, Sezan, how should we get
started finding Lane Lines?

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.919
&gt;&gt; Well, your ultimate goal in this
first section is to measure some of

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.300
the quantities that need to be
known in order to control the car.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.030
For example, to steer a car,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.670
you'll need to measure how
much your lane is curving.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.310
To do that, you need to map out
the lens in your camera images,

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.959
after transforming them to
a different perspective.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.600
One way, you're looking down
on the road from above.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.500
But, in order to get this
perspective transformation right,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.159
you first have to correct for
the effect of image distortion.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.250
&gt;&gt; So, by image distortion,
do you mean something like this?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.310
&gt;&gt; Well hopefully, the distortion we're
dealing with isn't quite that bad, but

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.800
yes, that's the idea.

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.899
Cameras don't create perfect images.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.609
Some of the objects in the images,
especially ones near the edges,

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.219
can get stretched or skewed in various
ways and you need to correct for that.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.759
&gt;&gt; Cool, let's jump into step one,

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:06.861
how to undistort your
distorted camera images.
