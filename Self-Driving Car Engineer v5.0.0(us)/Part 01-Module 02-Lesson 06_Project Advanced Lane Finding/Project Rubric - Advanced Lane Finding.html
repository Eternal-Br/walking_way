             Here the idea is to take the measurements of where the lane lines are and estimate how much the road is curving and where the vehicle is located with respect to the center of the lane.  The radius of curvature may be given in meters assuming the curve of the road follows a circle.  For the position of the vehicle, you may assume the camera is mounted at the center of the car and the deviation of the midpoint of the lane from the center of the image is the offset you're looking for.  As with the polynomial fitting, convert from pixels to meters.

             The fit from the rectified image has been warped back onto the original image and plotted to identify the lane boundaries.  This should demonstrate that the lane boundaries were correctly identified.  An example image with lanes, curvature, and position from center should be included in the writeup (or saved to a folder) and submitted with the project.

             The image processing pipeline that was established to find the lane lines in images successfully processes the video.  The output here should be a new video where the lanes are identified in every frame, and outputs are generated regarding the radius of curvature of the lane and vehicle position within the lane.   The pipeline should correctly map out curved lines and not fail when shadows or pavement color changes are present.  The output video should be linked to in the writeup and/or saved and submitted with the project.

        <h3>
         Tips to make your project standout:
        </h3>
        <p>
         <p>
          For a standout submission, you should follow the suggestion in the lesson to not just search blindly for the lane lines in each frame of video, but rather, once you have a high-confidence detection, use that to inform the search for the position of the lines in subsequent frames of video.  For example, if a polynomial fit was found to be robust in the previous frame, then rather than search the entire next frame for the lines, just a window around the previous detection could be searched.  This will improve speed and provide a more robust method for rejecting outliers.
         </p>
         <p>
          For an additional improvement you should implement outlier rejection and use a low-pass filter to smooth the lane detection over frames, meaning add each new detection to a weighted mean of the position of the lines to avoid jitter.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you really want to go above and beyond, implement these methods on the challenge videos as well, or on your own videos you've recorded yourself.
