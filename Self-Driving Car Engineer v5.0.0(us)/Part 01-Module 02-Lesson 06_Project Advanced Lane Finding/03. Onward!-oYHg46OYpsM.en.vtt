00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.810
&gt;&gt; There you have it.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.750
Everything you need to know to implement the first stage of your project.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.220
Thank you very much Sezan, for the enlightening discussion of

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.670
image distortion, warping, color spaces, and gradients.

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.089
&gt;&gt; It was my pleasure.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.219
I hope you enjoyed learning a bit about how cameras work.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.329
And how you can extract the maximum amount of information

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.379
from your images and a video.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:23.789
So Ryan, what do you think?

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.549
Will we be able to build a better lane mapping algorithm after this?

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.190
&gt;&gt; Yes indeed.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.260
I've tried these techniques out myself.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.770
And here is a sneak peek at the results I came up with.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.740
Here, I'm mapping out the lane and tracking its position,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.539
while measuring the lane curvature and

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.679
the position of my vehicle with respect to center in each frame.

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.060
Now, I think that's pretty cool.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.539
But I'm sure you'll come up with an even better implementation.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.060
So have fun and we'll see you in the next section.
