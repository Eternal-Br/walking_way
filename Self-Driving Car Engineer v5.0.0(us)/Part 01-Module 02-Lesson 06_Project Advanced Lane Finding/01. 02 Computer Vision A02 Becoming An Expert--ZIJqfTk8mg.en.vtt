00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
So now, we're going to up the ante a little bit and make it a bit more

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.320
challenging and a bit more real-world in giving you a stretch of a highway.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.429
It's just been more challenging, there's lighting changes,

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:11.660
there is color changes,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.435
there's underpasses, and it's a much more realistic scenario.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:17.609
I can tell you in terms of state of the art,

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.585
if you do a really good job here with camera alone,

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:22.710
you basically are reaching what I would

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.810
consider the state of the art in computer vision and self-driving cars.

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:31.079
So here's a chance to do a really great job and really impress me and many other people.
