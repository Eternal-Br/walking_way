00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
&gt;&gt; AlexNet is still used today as

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.189
a starting point for building and training neural networks.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.975
&gt;&gt; Actually, engineers typically use a simplified version of AlexNet

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:11.250
because in recent years we've discovered that some of

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.498
AlexNet's features aren't really necessary,

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:15.144
and so they've been removed.

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:18.960
But most implementations of AlexNet that you'll find online reflect these changes.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.719
&gt;&gt; Since AlexNet, a number of newer networks have been developed with even higher accuracy.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.224
But AlexNet is still one of the best understood

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:30.179
and most widely used starting points for computer vision.
