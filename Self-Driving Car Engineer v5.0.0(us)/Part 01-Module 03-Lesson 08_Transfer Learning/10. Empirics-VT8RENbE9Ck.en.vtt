00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
&gt;&gt; Deep learning is a hands on empirical field.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.825
The more experiments that we engineers and researchers try,

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:11.100
the more ideas we generate and some of them actually turn out to work.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.769
Other ideas that seem promising initially don't work.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.980
The practice is definitely ahead of the theory in many cases.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.089
And so it's important not to get too attached to theories about

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.335
different network architectures or exactly what layer follows another in a network,

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:28.510
instead to be a successful deep learning practitioner,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.775
You need a bias towards action.

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:35.489
Experiment to answer your questions rather than just thinking deep thoughts.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.410
Also don't be too discouraged if something

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.854
doesn't work immediately the first time you try it.

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:41.579
Keep experimenting until you find

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.809
a network and hyperparameters that work for your problem.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.179
&gt;&gt; I like to think of deep learning as one of the few places in

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.799
computer science where we actually do science.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.884
Most of computer science is really more about engineering,

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:58.004
but in deep learning we really do spend a lot of time

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.620
running experiments and building theories of what works and why,

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:03.320
just like real scientists.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.284
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say that does make us real scientists.

00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:10.140
You're learning about several important network architectures

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.855
that you can use as a basis for your own projects.

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:15.704
But more important than the intricacies of these networks,

00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:19.435
is to get your hands dirty and try to solve real problems.

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:22.460
This will develop your confidence and give you practical skills.

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:26.354
&gt;&gt; With that in mind, let's look at that other networks from 2014, 

00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:28.000
which has its own strengths.
