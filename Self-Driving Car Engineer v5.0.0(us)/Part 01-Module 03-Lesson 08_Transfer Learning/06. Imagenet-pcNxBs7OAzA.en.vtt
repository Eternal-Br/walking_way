00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.512
&gt;&gt; By the late aughts,

00:00:01.512 --> 00:00:04.980
the Internet had made it easier to generate and collect images,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.900
storage costs had dropped so that it was cheap to save large collections of images,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.780
and services like Amazon's Mechanical Turk had

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.855
even made it more cost-effective to label images.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.530
That confluence of factors gave rise to ImageNet,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.560
a huge database of hand-labeled images.

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:25.410
And the ImageNet database gave rise to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.394
the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition.

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:32.339
&gt;&gt; The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.680
is most famous as an annual competition,

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.259
where teams from industry and academia try to build

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:40.649
the best networks for object detection and localization.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.890
&gt;&gt; Kind of like this image.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.679
Is this a dog or a horse?

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.509
&gt;&gt; It's a horse.

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:51.299
Anyway, this spurred really intense competition between teams in

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.879
industry and academia to produce the best image classification network.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.780
And as these teams published their approaches,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.649
we learned a lot about the best ways to build neural networks.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.765
The first big breakthrough was in 2012,

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:06.629
when the winning submission really changed the field.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:07.897
It was called AlexNet,

00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:12.140
and it looked a lot like Yann LeCun's neural network from way back in 1998.
