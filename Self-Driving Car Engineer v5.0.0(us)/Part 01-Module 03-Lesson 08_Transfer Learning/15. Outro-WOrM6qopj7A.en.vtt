00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
&gt;&gt; AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet and ResNet are

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.955
important neural network architectures you might want to use in future projects.

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:13.155
And even if you build your own neural network from scratch,

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:15.344
you'll still want to fine-tune it.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:18.600
You can save your network as you train and then come back later to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
experiment with new data and additional layer or different hyperparameters.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.300
&gt;&gt; As you proceed to the final project.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.250
Think about how you might use all of the techniques you learned, including convolutions,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.350
pooling, dropout and transfer

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.490
learning to build your own neural network for behavioral cloning.
