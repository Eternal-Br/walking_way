00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
&gt;&gt; Hi Bryan.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.250
&gt;&gt; Hey David.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.799
&gt;&gt; So, you've got a pretty impressive title,

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.029
Vice President of Applied Deep Learning Research.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.404
What does a vice president do all day?

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:12.054
&gt;&gt; That's a great question, actually.

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:16.274
Right now, I'm looking for people with deep learning experience to come join my team.

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:17.609
But, most of my career,

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.379
I've spent building deep neural networks,

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.089
and infrastructure for deep learning,

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.675
and I still spend a lot of my time on that.

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:25.414
&gt;&gt; All right. So, impress me.

00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:29.629
What's the most amazing thing you've ever done with deep neural networks?

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.174
&gt;&gt; Well, one of the things I'm most proud of is that,

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:35.009
I wrote a library that became cuDNN,

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:36.929
which has become really important for using

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.769
GPUs to accelerate deep neural network training.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.690
&gt;&gt; All right. I'm impressed.

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.369
Bryan's being a little modest.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:45.659
cuDNN has become so important, in fact,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.279
that it's effectively a requirement for successfully training deep neural networks.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.320
&gt;&gt; Well, I certainly think so.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.179
&gt;&gt; So, cuDNN is great.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.149
I would be happy if I built one project too successful as cuDNN in my life.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.030
But beyond cuDNN, what's

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.564
the most exciting deep neural network you've been working on recently?

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:06.524
&gt;&gt; Well, the last big project I did was at Baidu,

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.400
and I was part of the deep speech team,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.890
where we built a new kind of end-to-end deep neural

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.939
network for speech recognition in English, and Mandarin Chinese.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.000
&gt;&gt; That is amazing.
