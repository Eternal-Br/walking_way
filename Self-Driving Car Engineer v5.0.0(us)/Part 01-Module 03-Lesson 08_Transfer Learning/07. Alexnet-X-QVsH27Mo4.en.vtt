00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.258
&gt;&gt; AlexNet was developed at the University of Toronto by Alex Krizhevsky,

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:07.544
Ilya Sutskever and their professor Geoffrey Hinton.

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:12.365
Although the fundamental architecture of AlexNet resembled LeNet from 1998,

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:16.089
AlexNet was a breakthrough in several respects.

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.320
&gt;&gt; First and foremost, AlexNet used

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.995
the massive parallelism afforded by GPUs to accelerate training.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:26.460
Using the best GPUs available in 2012,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.530
the AlexNet team was able to train the network in about a week.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.799
Additionally, AlexNet pioneered the use of Rectified Linear Units as

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:39.569
an activation function and dropout is a technique for avoiding overfitting.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.079
&gt;&gt; In 2011, the year before AlexNet was developed,

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.104
the winner of the ImageNet competition successfully classified 74% of images,

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:50.189
or in the terminology of the competition,

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:51.919
its error was 26%.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.939
The next year, AlexNet lowered its error to 15%.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.000
This was a huge leap forward.
