00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
The last subsystem in the vehicle is the control subsystem.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.799
This subsystem contains software components to ensure that

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.085
the vehicle follows the path specified by the planning subsystem.

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:17.660
The control subsystem may include components such as PID controllers,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.350
model predictive controllers, or other controllers.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.410
The control subsystem sense acceleration,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.370
braking, and steering commands to the vehicle.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.515
This completes the chain of information from sensors to actuation,

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:37.380
and allows the vehicle to drive.
