00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.169
Different components in the detection and localization subsystems

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:07.644
draw information from different sensors.

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:10.949
Additionally, the localization subsystem requires

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.954
map data which it uses to identify the vehicle's location.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:17.820
The perception subsystem passes the data from

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.300
localization and detection to the planning subsystem.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.140
The planning subsystem determines what maneuver the vehicle should undertake next.
