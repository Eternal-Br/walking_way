00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
Once data from the sensors has been processed by

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:07.709
the perception subsystem the vehicle can use that information to plan its path.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.259
There are several components of the planning system which you might

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.259
remember from the path planning module: route planning,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.718
which is the high level path of the vehicle between two points on a map;

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:19.844
prediction, which is what identifies which maneuver

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:23.234
other objects on the road might take; behavior planning,

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:26.051
which decides what maneuver our vehicle should take;

00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:31.369
and trajectory generation, which plots the precise path we'd like our vehicle to follow.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.469
Let's have a closer look at these components.
