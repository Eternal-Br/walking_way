The planning subsystem takes in data

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.330
from all of the components of the perception subsystem.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.644
Additionally, map data is used for long range planning.

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:16.399
Once the vehicle has a planned trajectory the next step is to execute that trajectory.

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:19.289
This is the responsibility of the control subsystem.
