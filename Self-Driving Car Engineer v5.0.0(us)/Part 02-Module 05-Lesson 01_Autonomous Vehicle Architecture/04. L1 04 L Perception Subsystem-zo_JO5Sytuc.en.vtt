00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
The perception subsystem, processes data from sensors into

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.314
structured information that can eventually be used for path planning or control.

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:12.209
This is where most of the vehicles analysis of the environment takes place.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.370
So we can think of the perception subsystem as

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.259
the vehicle center of understanding about its environment.

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.844
Broadly speaking, we can further divide the perception subsystem itself

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:28.169
into two underlying subsystems; detection and localization.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.230
The localization subsystem is responsible for using

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.160
sensor and map data to determine the vehicle's precise location.

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.944
The detection subsystem is responsible for understanding the surrounding environment.

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:44.325
This subsystem includes software components such as; lane detection,

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:48.344
traffic sign and traffic light detection classification,

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:52.135
object detection and tracking and free space detection.

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:56.865
Each component of the perception subsystem relies on a different group of sensors.

00:00:56.865 --> 00:01:01.340
Let's look at how the sensor subsystem and the perception subsystem are connected.
