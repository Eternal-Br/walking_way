00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Boy, I'm so impressed how far you've come,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.290
and I hope you're impressed too because you learn a lot of stuff here.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.419
Perception, sensor fusion, localization,

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.835
path planning, control, all these wonderful building blocks that make a self-driving car.

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:15.380
So, for this final units,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.589
it's now time for the truth.

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.050
The building blocks are one thing but we have to put them together into one system.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.250
So, this is the time and we take all these building blocks and turn them into

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.079
one big system and actually control a self-driving car end-to-end.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.730
This is actually how I spent most of my life building self-driving cars tucked away in

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:38.299
a small Volkswagen Touareg in front of a computer keyboard putting

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.149
building blocks together and then realizing

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.629
the car was drived on a ditch and you made a mistake.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.740
That is my life for many many years,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.920
is life for every self-driving car engineer and is possibly the hardest thing to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.460
do but it's also the most fulfilling because in

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.060
the end of the day it's not about understanding building blocks,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.830
it's about building self-driving cars.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.479
So, please dive in.
