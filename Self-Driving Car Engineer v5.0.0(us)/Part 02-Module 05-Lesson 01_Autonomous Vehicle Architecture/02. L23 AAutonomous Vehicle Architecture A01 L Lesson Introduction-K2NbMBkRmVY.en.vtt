00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.015
Welcome to System Integration,

00:00:02.015 --> 00:00:06.195
the final module of the Udacity self-driving car nanodegree program.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:07.970
Over the course of this program,

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:11.580
you've built the major components of an autonomous vehicle system.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.599
In this module, we'll be discussing the system architecture used in

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.754
the Udacity self-driving car so that you can fit all of the pieces together.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.375
Karla, the Udacity self-driving car,

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:24.675
has four major subsystems.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:27.660
The first subsystem is the sensor subsystem,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.884
which consists of the hardware components that gather data about the environment.

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:34.375
This subsystem includes LIDAR,

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:38.340
radar, cameras, and even GPS sensors mounted on the car.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.740
The second subsystem, the perception subsystem,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.010
consists of software to process sensor data.

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.759
You've built components of this subsystem already.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:53.509
Components in the perception subsystem combine sensor data into meaningful information.

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:57.844
The planning subsystem is the third subsystem on the vehicle.

00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:01.299
The planning subsystem uses the output from perception for

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.984
behavior planning and for both short and long range path planning.

00:01:05.984 --> 00:01:09.670
The final subsystem is the control subsystem,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.579
which ensures that the vehicle follows the path provided by

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.079
the planning subsystem and sends control commands to the vehicle.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.250
As we'll see, information generally flows through the sub-systems from left to right,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.140
starting with sensor input and ending with control commands for the vehicle.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.570
As we go through this lesson,

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.254
we'll go into more detail about

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.159
each subsystem and how it connects to the rest of the vehicle.
