Behavioral questions are very open-ended and sometimes it's hard to know how to respond; it's hard to know where to start. \n\nIn this lesson, you will have the opportunity to answer and reflect on interview questions generated by our own hiring managers, engineers, and students. Through practice you can become comfortable with the types of behavioral questions you are likely to encounter. \n\nAlso, you will review several job candidate answers from the interviewer’s perspective. This will allow you to experience both sides of the interview and analyze responses.\n",

As you watch, get into the mindset of the interviewer and ask yourself the following:\n\n- Do they use the STAR method?\n- What is their tone of voice?\n- Do they answer the question concisely or do they get off track?\n\n**NOTE: The answers you are about to see were recorded alone with a webcam so much of the conversational nature of these questions is lost. In a real interview, more back-and-forth discussion is likely to exist.*\n\nAs a reference, review this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TNLwa_ThJlliCk6Dk-_bkZU3ZMZOTEmezE2eX7i9rEg/pub?embedded=true\" target=\"_blank\">interviewing rubric</a>.
