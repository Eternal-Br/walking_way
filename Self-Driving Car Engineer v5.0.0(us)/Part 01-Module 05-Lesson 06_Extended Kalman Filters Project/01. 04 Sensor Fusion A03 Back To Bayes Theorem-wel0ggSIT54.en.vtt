00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
So, are we up for some torture?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.890
Now, we're going to program extended Kalman filter.

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:08.730
It's actually hard to do it turns out because even small errors in

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.700
computer derivatives lead to completely bizarre behave

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.160
in the output and they're very hard to debug.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.820
But, every student in the world,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.210
should at least once in their life implement DEKF.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.585
So, do it, it's fun, it's hard,

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.275
it's a real challenge,

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:23.759
and once you've done it, be proud.
