00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.040
It's time to combine situations and hazards together and then evaluate risks.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.354
Once we know how high our risks are,

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:15.720
we can figure out how to bring risks down to acceptable levels.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.060
Back in the introductory lesson,

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:23.424
we talked about evaluating risk with the equation risk equal severity,

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:25.605
times probability of occurrence.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.440
In that lesson, we simplified things a bit.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.911
In the ISO 26262 standard,

00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:35.685
the risk is defined slightly differently with the equation risk

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:41.940
equal severity of a malfunction times probability of loss due to a malfunction.

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.594
You have already seen severity in the introduction.

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:47.759
Probability of loss due to a malfunction takes into

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.184
account two terms called exposure and controllability.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:57.829
Risk then equals severity times exposure, times controllability.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.184
Let's discuss each one of these factors in turn.

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:03.425
We introduce severity earlier.

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:08.935
Severity measures how badly a person could get injured in an accident.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.594
In the ISO 26262 standard,

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:13.813
severity has four levels,

00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:17.669
labeled S0, S1, S2 and S3.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.984
S0 represents no injuries whereas S3 implies life threatening or fatal injuries.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:29.069
For example, a situation in which the vehicle travels

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.924
over 40 kilometers per hour would have severity of S3.

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:37.966
In the situational analysis for the lane departure warning,

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:41.429
we considered that the driver was traveling at a high speed,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.610
so the severity would be S3.

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.439
You can use this table below as a guide for

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.459
evaluating the severity of the situation under consideration.
