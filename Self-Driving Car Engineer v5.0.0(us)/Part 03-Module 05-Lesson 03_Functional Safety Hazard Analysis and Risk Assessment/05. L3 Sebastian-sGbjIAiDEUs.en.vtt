00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
In the Google car project,

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:03.180
the project has not driven more than I guess

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.945
two million miles and I was responsible for a good chunk of those.

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:10.320
It's quite amazing what kind of you encounter,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.940
really strange things when you drive a million miles.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:20.024
I challenge everybody to drive a million miles and write down what stuff happens.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:24.299
But what you find is that you find people driving the wrong way on the highway.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.699
You have a situation where a car right in

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.890
front of us did a 360 in a highway luckily nothing happened.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.219
We had an instance where

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.859
we had to break for a person running on the street in front of us.

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:39.225
In fact at some point we went through all the data and looked at instances of

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:42.149
extremely strong deceleration of braking and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.945
very often it was just the person running a red light in front of us.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.899
We actually have to admit I mean people

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.619
are worried about safety of the car getting into accidents.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.659
Being able to effectively get in to

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.024
zero accidents and after that it was a minor fender bender.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.269
For a car that's driven as far as you,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.000
I think quite an accomplishment to be honest given how bad some people drive.
