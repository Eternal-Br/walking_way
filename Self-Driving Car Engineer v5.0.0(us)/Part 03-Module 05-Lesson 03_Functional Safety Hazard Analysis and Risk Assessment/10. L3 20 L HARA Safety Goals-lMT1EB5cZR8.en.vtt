00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.581
The last step is to derive safety goals,

00:00:03.581 --> 00:00:06.609
which brings us back to requirements engineering.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.190
A safety goal defines what the item does to avoid hazardous situations.

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.834
So a safety goal is a type of requirement.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.265
For the lane departure warning function,

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:19.795
the hazardous event description was that

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:22.500
the lane departure warning function applies

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.646
too high an oscillating torque to the steering wheel,

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:27.744
which could lead to a crash.

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:32.935
What would the lane departure warning function need to do to avoid the situation?

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:34.940
Limit the amount of vibration.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:38.309
So the safety goal would be the oscillating steering torque

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.070
from the lane departure warning function shall be limited.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.719
So the safety goal has ASIL C. Limiting

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.579
the vibrational steering torque would help lower the risk to an acceptable.
