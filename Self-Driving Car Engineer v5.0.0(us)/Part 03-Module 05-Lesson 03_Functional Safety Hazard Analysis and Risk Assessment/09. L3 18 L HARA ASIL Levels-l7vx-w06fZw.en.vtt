00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.865
Severity, exposure and controllability provide a systematic way for evaluating risk.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:12.269
We take these three factors and combine them into

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.339
a metric called Automotive Safety Integrity Level or ASIL.

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:22.126
ASIL measures the amount of risk of each hazardous situation.

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:26.210
Lower risks are classified as ASIL A,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.260
whereas the highest risks are classified as ASIL B. ISO 26262

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.630
provides a table for combining the three terms together into an ASIL.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.240
Let's calculate the ASIL for our lane departure warning example.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.945
You can see in the table that combining S3,

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:50.340
E3 and C3 leads to ASIL C. So

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.445
excessive steering wheel vibration is a hazard with relatively high risk.

00:00:55.445 --> 00:01:01.424
This table brings up a couple of points that we haven't covered yet. What is QM?

00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:05.250
And what happens if a hazard has a severity,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.075
controllability or exposure levels of S0, E0 or C0?

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:14.969
If the risk assessment contains an S0,

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:21.209
E0 or C0, then the risk is automatically marked as QM.

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:23.909
QM stands for quality management and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.289
implies that the risk is already below acceptable levels.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.770
There is no need to apply ISO 26262 to

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:36.509
a hazardous situation of QM because risk is already low enough.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.560
However, there are other standards that apply including

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.290
the automotive quality management standard IATF 16949.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.410
Now that we know how to evaluate risks,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.000
we will discuss what the system needs to do in order to lower the risk.
