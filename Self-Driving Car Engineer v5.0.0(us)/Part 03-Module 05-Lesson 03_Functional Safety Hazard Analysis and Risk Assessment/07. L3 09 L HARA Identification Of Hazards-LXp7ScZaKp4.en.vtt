00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
After a situation analysis,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.480
the next step is to identify hazards.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.500
Remember that for ISO 26262 hazardous situations arise

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.304
from electronic malfunctions that could cause injury to humans or damage human health.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:19.309
Malfunctions are unintended behavior.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.579
If the purpose of the lane departure of

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.594
warning function is to vibrate the steering wheel,

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:28.724
a malfunction could be that the vibration is too strong.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:31.980
The hazard is that the driver could lose control of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.869
the steering wheel which could result in a risk of collision with another vehicle.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.419
Like the situation analysis,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.135
we have a list of guide words to identify malfunctions.

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:49.335
We also have a list of potential accidents or hazardous events that could occur.

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:54.225
Notice that we are not yet concerned with the technical implementation of the item.

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:57.899
For instance, we are not yet thinking about which part of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.549
the lane departure of warning is causing the excessive vibrations.

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.979
Maybe it could be a software bug or an issue with the vibration motor.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.040
But we are not concerned with that level of detail yet.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.760
We also assume that every other item in the vehicle is functioning correctly.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.805
We're only concerned with the lane assistance item.

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:22.515
An entire hazard identification would include the function definition,

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:26.284
the malfunction under consideration chosen from the guide words,

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:28.140
the details of the malfunction,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.974
the accident called the hazardous event,

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:35.994
details about the event and a summary description of the hazardous event.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.745
So the complete hazard identification for

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:42.469
our lane departure warning example would look like this.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.569
In the next step we'll combine situations and hazards together and measure risk.
