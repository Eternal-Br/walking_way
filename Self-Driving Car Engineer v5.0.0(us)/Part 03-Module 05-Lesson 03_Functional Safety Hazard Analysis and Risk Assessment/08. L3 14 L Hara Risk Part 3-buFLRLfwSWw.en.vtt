00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
The final tone for evaluating risk is controllability.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.259
Controllability measures how likely the driver will be

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.399
able to gain control of the vehicle during a hazardous event.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.169
Controllability has a scale from C0 to C3,

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.820
where C3 is a situation

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.304
where an average driver could not maintain control of the vehicle.

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:26.399
If the lane departure warning function causes the steering wheel to

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.209
vibrate excessively with wild swings of the steering wheel,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.460
most drivers would have difficulty controlling the vehicle.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.359
We will put the controllability at C3.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.039
We are also providing a table to help

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.204
distinguish between different controllability levels.

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:47.579
We can now evaluate the risk of our lane departure.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.030
One example, we will combine severity,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.890
exposure and controllability into a risk factor called ASIL.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.000
Next, we will discuss ASIL in more depth.
