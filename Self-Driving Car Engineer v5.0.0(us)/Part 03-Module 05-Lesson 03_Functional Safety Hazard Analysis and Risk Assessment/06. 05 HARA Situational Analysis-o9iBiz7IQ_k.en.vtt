00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
We are going to analyze the lane keeping resistance system,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.485
and discuss how to do a situational analysis.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.220
Remember that we want to anticipate what accidents

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.115
might occur and prevent those accidents from ever happening.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:19.589
So we need to imagine hypothetical driving situations and

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:25.660
analyze what would happen if the vehicle malfunction in each situation.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.960
Here is an example of a driving situation.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.780
Driving in reverse on a country road with

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.520
normal driving conditions at high-speed and correct use of the system.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.239
We could come up with hundreds or thousands of driving scenarios through brainstorming.

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:47.884
To help with the brainstorming process,

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:51.530
we can use predefined guide words to create a scenario.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.890
A situation analysis can then be like a fill-in-the-blank exercises that goes like this.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.585
Operational mode on operational scenario,

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:07.879
during environmental details with situational details and item usage system.

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:10.909
For example, backward driving on

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.265
a city road during fog with low speed and correctly used system.

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:19.400
We have provided guide words for you below.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.849
When you think about item usage,

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.734
consider whether on not the driver is using the system as intended.

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:31.625
For example, a sedan is meant to drive in urban areas.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:35.150
A misuse would be driving off road at high-speed.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.125
Analyzing every possible driving scenario would not be possible.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:43.459
So we want to be smart about how we choose our scenarios.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.699
We need to take into account the item's purpose,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.329
combined similar situations, and concentrate on

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.355
the most critical scenarios where the item could malfunction.

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:59.135
For the lane departure warning function that vibrates the steering wheel,

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:01.994
let's focus on highway driving in the rain.

00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:05.494
We will use the guide words to define our situation.

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:07.760
Normal driving on a highway with

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.379
a wet slippery road at high-speed and correctly used system.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.224
There may be other critical situations besides the one that we have identified.

00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:22.284
But we will use this situation as an example throughout the rest of the lesson.

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:25.849
Now that we can identify driving situations,

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.849
we can start to think about how the vehicle could malfunction.
