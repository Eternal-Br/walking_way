00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.905
You now have the tools to carry out hazard analysis and risk assessment.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:07.470
Let's summarize what we have learned.

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.414
First we decided which vehicle item was under consideration.

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:14.839
In this case we were looking at a lane assistance item.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.030
Then we identified various driving situations.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.950
The next step was to imagine

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.544
lane assistance malfunctions that could lead to hazardous situations.

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:29.100
We assessed risk based on severity, exposure, and controllability.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.495
The risk assessment produced [inaudible] for these hazardous situations.

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:39.195
In the final step, we define what the item needs to do in order to remain safe.

00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:40.710
These are called safety goals.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.605
In the next lesson we are going to refine the safety goals.

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:49.634
We will determine which subsystems are responsible for meeting the safety goals.

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:53.000
This process will be documented in a functional safety concept.
