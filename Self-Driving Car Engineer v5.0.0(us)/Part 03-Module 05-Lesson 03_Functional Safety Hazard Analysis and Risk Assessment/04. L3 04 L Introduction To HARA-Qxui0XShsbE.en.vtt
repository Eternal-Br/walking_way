00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
In introductory lesson, you already saw

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:06.205
basic ideas behind identifying hazards and assessing risks.

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:12.839
ISO 26262, formalizes this process with hazard analysis and risk assessment.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.359
Remember, that the ultimate goal of

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.280
functional safety is to reduce risks to levels acceptable by society.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.382
In hazard analysis and risk assessment,

00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:26.070
you will figure out what could go wrong with your item.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.344
Then, you will measure the risk associated with it unintended behavior.

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:36.969
You will then identify what the item needs to do to remain safe.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.753
We will call this unintended behavior, a malfunction.

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:44.244
For example, if a lane keeping a system function,

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.364
don't twist the steering wheel too hard,

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:49.125
the driver could loose control of the vehicle.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.405
There is a potential for vehicle accident,

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:55.980
so excessive torque would be a malfunction that leads to hazardous situation.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.689
The hazard analysis and risk assessment contains five parts.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:04.995
Situational analysis, where you identify driving conditions,

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.975
like city driving in rain.

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:09.719
Hazard identification, where you

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.144
analyze what goes wrong with the item under consideration.

00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:17.129
Classification of the situation and

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:22.039
hazard according to severity and probability of occurrence.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.925
Calculating the ASIL.

00:01:23.924 --> 00:01:29.000
Driving safety goals that identify what the system will do to lower risk.
