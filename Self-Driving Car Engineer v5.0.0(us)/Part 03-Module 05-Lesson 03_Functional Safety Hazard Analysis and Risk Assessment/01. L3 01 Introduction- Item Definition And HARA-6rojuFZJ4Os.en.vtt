00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
Now, we are going to refine how we analyze hazards and assess risks.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:10.410
Before we start, we need to define which part of vehicle will be under consideration.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.384
We are going to use an Advanced Driver Assistance System,

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:16.070
in short ADAS, as an example.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.315
Once we have chosen a system to investigate,

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:20.609
we need to brainstorm and come up with

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.129
different driving scenarios like driving in

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.279
the snow on a highway or parked in a parking lot.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.390
We call this situational analysis.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.270
Separately, we'll think about different ways that the vehicle can malfunction.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.670
We'll brainstorm again to identify what could go wrong with the ADAS.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.795
We will then evaluate malfunctions on

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:44.295
the various driving scenarios and calculate a risk factor called ASIL,

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:47.660
automotive safety integrity level.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.169
The ultimate goal of hazard analysis and risk assessment is to define

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.000
requirements specifying what ADAS needs to do in order to avoid hazardous situations.
