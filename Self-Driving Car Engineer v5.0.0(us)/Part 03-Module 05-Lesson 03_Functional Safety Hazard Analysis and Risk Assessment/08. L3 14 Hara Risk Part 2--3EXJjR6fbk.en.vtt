00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
Now, let's talk about Exposure.

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:08.865
Do you remember from the introductory lesson the definition of probability of occurrence,

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:13.560
probability of occurrence actually measures how often or

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.774
how long drivers would find themselves in a specific situation?

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:23.474
For example, driving on a freeway parked in a parking lot,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.275
or driving on a wet road.

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:28.649
Exposure is defined exactly like how

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.600
we define probability of occurrence in the introductory lesson.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.745
Exposure has scale from E0 to E4.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.640
For our lane departure warning example,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.734
the situation involved highway driving on VicRoads.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.299
According to functional safety standard,

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:48.149
driving on VicRoads is E3.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.000
The chart below gives a sense of how to determine exposure levels.
