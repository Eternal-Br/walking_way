00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.794
Congratulations!

00:00:01.794 --> 00:00:05.000
You've learned how to build a Model Predictive Controller.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.879
You're now well-equipped to take a vehicle from A to B.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.030
PAD Control and Model Predictive Control are two

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.269
of the fundamental techniques that control engineers use to activate vehicles.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.769
In the next project,

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.369
you'll apply the techniques you've learned to do the Udacity simulator in real time.
