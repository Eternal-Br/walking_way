00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Model predictive control uses

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.990
an optimizer to find the control inputs and minimize the cost function.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.419
We actually only execute the very first set of control inputs.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.580
This brings the vehicle to a new state and then you repeat the process.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.339
Here is the MPC algorithm.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.634
First, we set up everything required for the model predictive control loop.

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:21.630
This consists of defining the duration of the trajectory,

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:23.554
T, by choosing N and dt.

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:29.410
Next, we define the vehicle model and constraints such as actual limitations.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.225
Finally, we define the cost function.

00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:32.745
With the setup complete,

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:34.714
we begin to state feedback loop.

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:37.885
First, we pass the current state to the model predictive controller.

00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:40.085
Next, the optimization solver is called.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:41.999
The solver uses the initial state,

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:44.260
the model constraints and cost function to

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:47.739
return a vector of control inputs that minimize the cost function.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.319
The solver we'll use is called IPOPT.

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.400
We apply the first control input to the vehicle and repeat the loop.
