00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629
The cost function is not limited to the state.

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.894
We could also include the control input.

00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:06.750
The reason we would do this is to allow us to

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.778
penalize the magnitude of the input as well as the change rate.

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:11.964
If we want to change lanes, for example,

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:14.009
we would have a large cross-tracker that would

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.390
want to penalize turning the wheel really sharply.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.934
This would yield a smoother lane change.

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:22.570
We could add the control input magnitude like this.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.350
We still need to capture the change rate of

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.149
the control input to add some temporal smoothness.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.449
This additional term in the cost function captures the difference between

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.100
the next control input state and

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.000
the current one so we have further control over the inputs.
