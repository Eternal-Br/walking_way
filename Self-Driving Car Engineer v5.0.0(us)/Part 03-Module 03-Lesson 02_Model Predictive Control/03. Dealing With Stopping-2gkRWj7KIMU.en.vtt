00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.024
If the goal is to move the vehicle from A to B then

00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:06.359
coming to a halt in the middle of the reference trajectory is a problem.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.599
A simple solution is a set of reference velocity,

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.140
to cross-functional penalize the vehicle for not maintaining that reference velocity.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.980
In this case imagine the reference velocity is 35 mph.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.309
Another option is to measure the Euclidean distance between the current position of

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.449
the vehicle and the destination and then add that distance to the cost.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.149
There may be other great alternatives though. Feel free to think of one.
