00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.635
It's project time again.

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.009
This time you're going to implement, guess what?

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.990
Localization. The project we've picked for you is called Sparse Localization,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.775
by which you localize relative to a sparse set of landmarks using particle filters.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:19.710
The reason why we choose sparse as opposed to dense variable big maps is

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.179
actually much easier to code and you learn

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.509
all the essentials as well as dense localization.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.359
So dive in and build your very first own end-to-end localizer.
