00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.030
&gt;&gt; Recognizing what's in an image is the essence of computer vision.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.200
When we look at the world through our own eyes,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.589
we're constantly performing classification tasks with our brain.

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:10.859
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.190
And in the case of self-driving cars, reliable object detection and

00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:17.746
classification are essential to giving the car to see the world just like we

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:17.981
do.

00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:21.446
In this lesson, your goals to learn how to identify vehicles in images but

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:23.001
it doesn't end there.

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.009
You'll need to come up with the methods for separating false positives from

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.590
real detections and in track the real detections from one frame to the next.

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.368
So Arpan, where would you like to begin?

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:34.640
&gt;&gt; Well, like any good machine learning problem,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.119
it all begins with feature extraction.

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:39.989
So, first we'll look at how to compute features that

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.730
we can use to reliably identify cars in our images.
