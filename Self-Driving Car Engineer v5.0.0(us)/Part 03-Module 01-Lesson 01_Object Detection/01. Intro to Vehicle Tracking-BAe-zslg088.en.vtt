00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.850
&gt;&gt; The overarching theme in this module is how to find what you're looking for

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.799
in images.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.299
In previous lessons, we've accomplished this task for

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.740
the most part using colors and gradients.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.550
Now that you're familiar with some popular classifiers,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.110
we're going to go deeper into our exploration of colors and

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.619
gradients to see how you can locate and classify objects in images.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.769
&gt;&gt; Image classification is tricky.

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.550
And it becomes even trickier when you don't know exactly where in an image

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.580
your objects of interest will appear or

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.469
what size they'll be or even how many of them you might find.

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:34.619
Coming up, you'll focus on the task of detecting vehicles in

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:38.449
images taken from a camera mounted on the front of a car.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.970
But the same principles apply to pedestrian detection, or traffic sign

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.640
detection, or identifying any object you might be looking for in an image.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.939
&gt;&gt; In this lesson, you'll practice searching for objects in images.

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:54.199
And you'll explore what features are the most useful input for your classifier.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.270
With those tools, you'll then work on tracking vehicles in a video stream.
