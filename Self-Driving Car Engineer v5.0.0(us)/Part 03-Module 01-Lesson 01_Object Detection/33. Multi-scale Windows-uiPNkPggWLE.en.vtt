00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.290
In general, you won't know what size your object of interest will be in

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.669
the image you're searching.

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:07.179
So makes sense to search in multiple scales.

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:09.689
In this case, it's good idea to establish a minimum and

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.070
a maximum scale at which you expect the object to appear, and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.239
then reasonable number of intermediate scales to scan as well.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.980
The think to be careful about here is that the total number of windows you're

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.250
searching can increase rapidly which means your algorithm will run slower.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.160
You're looking for vehicles, so it makes sense through restrict your search

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.589
to the only areas of the images where vehicles might appear.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.200
Furthermore, when it comes to scale, you know for

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.880
example that vehicles that appear small will be near the horizon.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.820
So search in a small scales could be restricted to even narrow a strip

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.380
across the image.
