00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.580
Okay, let's summarize our overall tracking pipeline.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.660
In each frame of the video, you will run a search for

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.009
vehicles using a sliding window technique.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.759
Wherever your classifier returns a positive detection,

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.580
you'll record the position of the window in which the detection was made.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.500
In some cases you might detect the same vehicle in overlapping windows or

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.300
at different scales. In the case of overlapping detections you're going to

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.120
assign the position of the detection to the centroid of the overlapping windows.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.750
We also have false positives which you'll filter out

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.039
by determining which detections appear in one frame but not the next.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.479
Once you have a high confidence detection you can record how it's

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.629
centroid is moving from frame to frame and

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.400
you eventually estimate where it will appear in each subsequent frame.
