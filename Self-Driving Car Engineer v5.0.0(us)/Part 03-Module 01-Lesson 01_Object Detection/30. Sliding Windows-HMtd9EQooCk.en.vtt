00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.799
&gt;&gt; Okay, so now you've decided which features to extract from each image, and

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.209
you've trained a classifier using label data.

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:08.240
Great work.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.390
The next step is to implement a method of searching for objects, in this case,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.080
for vehicles in an image.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.239
So how are we going to do that, Drew?

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.725
&gt;&gt; Well, you've seen that you can consider cutouts or

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:22.150
subregions of an image, and run your classifier on each subregion

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:24.399
to see if it contains the object you're trying to detect.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.739
So what you'll do next is implement a sliding window technique,

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.739
where you'll step across an image in a grid pattern and

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.129
extract the same features you trained your classifier on in each window.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.940
You'll run your classifier to give a prediction at each step.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:36.619
And with any luck,

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.070
it will tell you which windows in your image contains cars.
