00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
So we had a very unusual way to building requirements.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.820
We had the car build the requirements for us.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.230
I'm very well aware that there's

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.589
a rich literature on redundant systems and on safety assurance.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:14.939
But at the time,

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:19.140
I felt we could get in trouble with another peer system or

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.850
build a better software solution for driving over intersections, or other terrain.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.290
And when I looked at where were the cars most important failures,

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.379
they were not in the computer architecture.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:30.830
We never really had a computer failure.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.250
We've had lots, and lots,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.155
and lots, and lots, of software failures.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.734
So what we end up doing is we started a testing team,

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:40.935
and testing team grew into like 10-15 people team very rapidly,

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:43.605
and we send them out every day and say, "Go and test".

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:46.789
They hit a button in the car and when something happen of interest,

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:47.850
they will just hit the button,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.289
record the voice and say, "Here's what I saw".

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.445
That stream would automatically give back to the engineers,

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:55.625
and every night engineers would look over and say,

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.920
"There's a mapping error, or there's a localization error,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.535
or there's a software error of this type.

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:01.919
Oh my God, there's a flying stroller coming from

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.650
a cliff and meeting a rotten tomato halfway, that's the problem."

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.757
And then we would, every week,

00:01:08.757 --> 00:01:11.020
trial these problems into a long list.

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:15.099
And typically there was one problem has accounted for 80% of the problems.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:20.009
The next taking of a problem was another 15% and then it percolates all the way down.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.875
And we end up just fixing the biggest problem.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.680
Every time we fixed the biggest problem the car got twice as good,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.155
three- four times as good.

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:28.905
And as a result, it got about,

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:32.510
I would say ten times as good every year, roughly, every year.
