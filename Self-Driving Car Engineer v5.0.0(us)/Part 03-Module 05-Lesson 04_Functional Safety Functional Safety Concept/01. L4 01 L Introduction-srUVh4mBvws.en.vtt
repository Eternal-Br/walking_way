00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's emphasize again the ultimate goal of functional safety,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.804
avoiding accidents by reducing risk to acceptable levels.

00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:09.449
First let's figure out what subsystems actually

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.134
contain high levels of risk and what's needed to prevent accidents.

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:15.224
Looking at the items architectural design,

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.530
you'll figure out which subsystems and elements can be used to meet safety goals.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.050
You'll need to further refine these high level goals

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.894
into what we call functional safety requirements.

00:00:24.894 --> 00:00:26.085
And then you'll allocate

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:30.420
each functional safety requirement to its appropriate place in the item architecture.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.670
We take all of this information and put it into

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.280
a document called the functional safety concept.
