00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Deriving functional safety requirements and allocating those requirements to

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.324
the system architecture is the main part of a functional safety concept.

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:09.809
To finish up the lesson,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.935
we still need to talk about three more attributes of a functional safety requirement.

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:16.890
The fault tolerant time interval,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.050
the warning and degradation concept,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.019
and the verification of validation acceptance criteria.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.484
We'll start with the fault tolerant time interval.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:30.684
We need to define how long the system has to detect and then react to a malfunction.

00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:33.679
We call this the fault tolerant time interval.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.284
Let's look at our ADS lane departure warning as an example.

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:41.294
One concern is that the warning vibration amplitude will be too high.

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.820
If the amplitude does get too high then a malfunction,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.545
also called the fault, has occurred.

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.234
It will take the system a certain amount of time to detect

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:53.839
a malfunction and signals travel through the hardware and the software.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.375
This is the diagnostic test interval.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.965
Once the system detects the high amplitude,

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:03.300
it will take time for the vehicle to turn off the lane departure warning function.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.340
This is the fault reaction time.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.549
Once turned off, the lane assistance system has reached

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.879
a safe state where risk is at acceptable levels.

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:16.974
We want the lane assistance system to reach a safe state before an accident has occurred.

00:01:16.974 --> 00:01:19.679
So there is a buffer between when the system reaches

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.830
a safe state and when an accident would have occurred.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.590
So fault tolerant time interval equals

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.314
diagnostic test interval plus fault

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:32.655
reaction time plus time in safe state before an accident.

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:36.665
Each safety requirement receives a fault tolerant time interval.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:39.435
We will say that the lane departure warning system

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:43.060
has a fault tolerant time interval of 50 milliseconds.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.030
You can use this value for the two functional safety requirements already discussed.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.420
This is an example of value you might see in practice but

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.329
the real world lane departure warning function might have a different value.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.659
The fault tolerant time interval let's us know

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.629
how much time the vehicle has to react to a malfunction.
