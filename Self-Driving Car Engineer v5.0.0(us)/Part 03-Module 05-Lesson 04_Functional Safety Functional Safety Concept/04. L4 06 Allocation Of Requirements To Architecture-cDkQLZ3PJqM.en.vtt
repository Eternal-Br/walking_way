00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.775
Our lane departure warning system now has two functional safety requirements.

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:08.550
One requirement limits the steering wheel vibration frequency,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.535
and the other requirement limits the steering wheel amplitude.

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:15.870
Now we have to figure out which part of the lane keeping the item will be

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.625
responsible for limiting the vibration torque and the amplitude.

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.469
The lane assistance item has three subsystems,

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:24.779
the camera, the display,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.820
and the electronic power steering.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.995
Let's take a look at the architectural diagram.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:33.570
Logically, we could say that both the camera subsystem and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.060
electronic steering subsystem could limit the frequency and the amplitude.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.060
For instance, we could make a requirement that the camera subsystem

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.500
can only request a vibrational torque below a maximal threshold.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.070
And we could also make a requirement that the power steering system

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.895
can only output a vibrational torque below the same limit.

00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:57.340
But we want to reduce the complexity whenever possible.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.670
The simpler solution is to only require

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.284
the power steering to limit the vibration no matter what the camera ask for.

00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:06.599
Now the only relevant subsystem

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.019
from a functional safety standpoint is the power steering.

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:11.944
For the lane departure warning,

00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:16.184
the allocation of the requirements to the architecture is straightforward.

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:21.299
Only an electronic power steering ECU is involved with limiting the vibration warning.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.579
The two functional safety requirements are allocated to the power steering ECU.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.659
We will also slightly change the wording in the functional safety requirements,

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.179
whereas before we said the lane keeping item had to limit the vibrational torque,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.270
now we'll be more explicit and say the power steering, ECU,

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:41.819
will limit the vibrational torque.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.594
Here are the final safety requirements: Functional safety requirement 1.

00:01:46.594 --> 00:01:49.980
The electronic power steering ECU shall ensure that

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.500
the lane departure warning oscillating torque amplitude is below max torque amplitude.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.944
Functional safety requirement 2.

00:01:57.944 --> 00:02:01.229
The electronic power steering ECU shall ensure that

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.844
the lane departure warning oscillating torque frequency is below max torque frequency.

00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:09.219
We can put the results in a table.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.984
Note that we are using a simplified example.

00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:13.170
Oftentimes, you will have

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:18.000
a functional safety requirement that gets allocated to multiple subsystems.
