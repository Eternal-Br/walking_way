00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
We need to add ASIL labels to the refined architectural diagram.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.009
Otherwise, we won't know which subsystems and elements require analysis under ISO 26262.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.834
The general rule is that

00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:17.265
functional safety requirements inherit the ASIL directly from the safety goal.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.217
From the hazard analysis and risk assessment,

00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:24.059
the lane departure warning safety goal was that the torque had to be limited.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.239
We determined that the safety goal had ASIL

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.809
C. The two functional safety requirements for the lane departure warning

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.929
would then inherit the ASIL C. Because we allocated

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.054
these two functional safety requirements to electronic power steering,

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:42.000
the entire subsystem inherits the ASIL C classification.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.090
But what about the ASIL of the camera in the car display subsystems?

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.260
We said earlier that the only relevant subsystem from

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:52.949
the functional safety standpoint was the electronic power steering.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.995
We do not have any functional safety requirements for these two subsystems.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:01.169
Therefore, we can mark the camera in the car display as QM.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.385
As a reminder, a QM rating stands for quality management.

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:09.329
Any part of the architecture where the QM rating is no longer relevant to

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.730
a functional safety analysis because the risk is already at acceptable levels.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.295
Here's a quick review of what we have accomplished so far.

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:21.659
We derived functional safety requirements from the safety goals,

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.069
refined the architecture and allocated the functional safety requirements to

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.974
the architecture and we determine the risk levels for the three subsystems.

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:36.000
Next, we'll see if there are any ways to lower the ASIL for any of our system elements.
