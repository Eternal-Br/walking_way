00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
For each functional safety requirement,

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.955
we need to discuss how the driver will be warned of the malfunction.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:08.786
For the lane assistance item malfunctions,

00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:11.230
we will display a warning on the driver dashboard.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.530
If the steering wheel ECU receives

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.929
a vibrational torque request beyond the allowed maximum,

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.800
a warning light will turn on.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.274
Here is an updated system diagram taking into account the warning lights.

00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:25.079
Note that we have added a connection from

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.919
the power steering ECU to the driver display subsystem.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.375
We also need to describe what the vehicle system will do after a malfunction occurs.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.103
When a malfunction occurs,

00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:39.704
the system needs to go to a state with a lower acceptable risk level.

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:42.679
This lower risk level is called a safe state.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.469
We have already said that both the lane departure warning function and the lane

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.820
keeping the system function will turn off when a safety requirement is violated.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.950
Turning a system off can generally be

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.085
considered a safe state with acceptable risk levels.

00:00:56.085 --> 00:00:59.370
A warning and degradation concept will include how

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:03.044
the driver will be alerted when the system has reduced functionality,

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:04.920
or is turned off completely,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.939
and how the vehicle will transition to and recover from the safe state.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.685
The car manual should include information from the warning a degradation concept as well.

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:15.933
For the lane keeping assistance function,

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.940
the manual would probably include a warning that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.655
the functionality is not meant for autonomous driving,

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:24.719
and the driver maintains responsibility for the safe operation of.
