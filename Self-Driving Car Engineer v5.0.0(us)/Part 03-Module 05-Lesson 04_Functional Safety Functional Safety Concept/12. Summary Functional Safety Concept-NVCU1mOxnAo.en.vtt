00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
We have defined safety requirements at the functional level

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:06.265
and then allocated those requirements to the item architecture.

00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:09.869
We now know what level of risk is contained in the item and we

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:14.154
have added extra functionality to make sure that the item behaves in a safe manner.

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:18.214
The next step is to look at the safety requirements from a technical perspective.

00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:19.695
We've said, for example,

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:24.750
that the steering wheel warning vibration amplitude and frequency need to be limited.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.836
But what software and hardware elements are we

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:29.355
going to need in order to limit the vibration?

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:33.795
What are those hardware and software elements going to do to ensure functional safety?

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:35.201
In the next lesson,

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:39.240
we will refine our functional safety requirements and the technical safety requirements.
