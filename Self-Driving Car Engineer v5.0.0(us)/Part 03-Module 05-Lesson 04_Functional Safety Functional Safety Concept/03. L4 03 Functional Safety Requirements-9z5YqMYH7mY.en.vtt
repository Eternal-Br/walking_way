00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
Going back to the lane departure warning example.

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:08.030
Let's derive a couple of functional safety requirements from our first safety goal.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.594
Our malfunction was that the steering wheel warning vibration was too strong.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.839
The malfunction led to the safety goal that the oscillating

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.199
steering torque of a lane departure warning function shall be limited.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.189
For the lane departure warning system,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.480
it makes sense to define

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.440
a maximum allowed torque amplitude and a maximum allowed frequency.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.950
From the safety goal,

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.589
we will define two functional safety requirements for the lane warning departure system.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.750
Functional safety requirement one.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.170
The lane keeping items shall ensure that the lane departure

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.920
oscillating torque amplitude is below max torque amplitude.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.844
Functional safety requirement two.

00:00:46.844 --> 00:00:49.049
The lane keeping item shall ensure that

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:54.419
the lane departure oscillating torque frequency is below max torque frequency.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.835
Notice again that we use the term shell,

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:59.219
because these are requirements.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.254
So what have we done so far?

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:05.370
We started with a safety goal requiring the vibration to be limited.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.740
We looked at the item architecture and came up with

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:10.859
two new requirements that would meet our safety goal.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.769
We then figured out that the lane assistance item needed to

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:17.009
limit the vibration amplitude and vibration frequency.
